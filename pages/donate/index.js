              <h2>How will DPLA use your donation?</h2>
              <p>
                Your donation will directly support the development and
                expansion of America's largest digital library for people like
                Adena, a high school school teacher in West Virginia. Adena uses
                Primary Source Sets in her teaching, and here's a few of her own
                words on how important they are to her:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                “I teach in a rural West Virginia high school. Many of my
                students have never left the state of West Virginia, but the
                Digital Public Library of America's Primary Source Sets deliver
                context and new landscapes while allowing my students to
                experience the highs and lows of American History, and to view
                history through a variety of viewpoints, collected from the
                nation's cultural heritage institutions.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Please consider making a donation to the Digital Public Library
                of America so we can continue to build these important
                educational materials.
