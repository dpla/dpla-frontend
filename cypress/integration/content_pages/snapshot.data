For individual rights information about an item, please\n            check the “Rights” field in the metadata, or follow the link to the\n            digital object on the content provider’s website for more\n            information.</p>\n          <h2>What are those icons on a DPLA record?</h2>\n          <p><a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org\"\n              class=\"external\">Rights Statements</a> icons are part of a new\n            endeavor, developed in collaboration with Europeana, to clearly\n            communicate the copyright status of items available on our site.

For example, metadata may include the\n            title of an item, the name of the creator of the work, the date on\n            which it was first created or published, or where the physical\n            object is located. Metadata in DPLA may also contain a brief\n            description that provides information about the historical and\n            cultural context of an item.

Our cultural heritage partners collect materials from history,\n            as well as artifacts from many cultures and time periods, to\n            preserve and make available the historical record. As a result, some\n            of the materials presented here may reflect outdated, biased,\n            offensive, and possibly violent views and opinions due to pervasive\n            systemic intolerance. In addition, some cultural heritage\n            institutions collect and preserve materials relating to violent or\n            graphic events which are preserved for their historical\n            significance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n          <h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n          <h4>Where does this content come from?</h4>\n\n\n\n          <p>Digital Public Library of America collects and makes freely\n            available materials from more than 4,000 libraries, archives,\n            museums, and other cultural heritage organizations across the United\n            States. Each institution or contributor shares materials with the\n            DPLA according to its specific policies and objectives. DPLA\n            aggregates this digital content, which means the portal points back\n            to partner’s organizations websites where the items are hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n          <h4><strong>What harmful or difficult content may be found in\n              DPLA?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n          <p>Some items may:</p>\n\n\n\n          <ul>\n            <li>reflect white supremacist and American imperialist ideologies,\n              which include racist, sexist, misogynistic/misogynoir, and\n              xenophobic opinions and attitudes.</li>\n            <li>be discriminatory towards or exclude diverse views on sexuality,\n              gender, ableism, religion, and more.</li>\n            <li>include graphic content of historical events such as violent\n              death, medical procedures, crime, post mortem photography,\n              wars/terrorist acts, natural disasters and more.</li>\n            <li>demonstrate bias and exclusion in institutional collecting and\n              digitization policies.</li>\n          </ul>\n\n\n\n          <h4>Why does DPLA make potentially harmful content available?</h4>\n\n\n\n          <p>DPLA and its partners collect, preserve, and present these\n            materials as part of the historic record, which does include\n            depictions and records of people experiencing trauma and harm.\n            Librarians and archivists working in conjunction with DPLA seek to\n            balance the preservation of this history with sensitivity to how\n            these materials are presented to and perceived by users.</p>\n\n\n\n          <h4><strong>How is this material described, and why are some of the\n              terms used in the descriptions harmful?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n          <ul>\n            <li>Librarians and archivists choose what language to use when\n              describing materials. Some of these descriptions were written many\n              years ago, using language that was accepted at the time.</li>\n            <li>Librarians and archivists often re-use language provided by\n              creators or former owners of the material. This can provide\n              important context, but can also reflect biases and prejudices.\n            </li>\n            <li>Librarians and archivists often use a standardized set of terms,\n              such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, to describe\n              materials.&nbsp; Some of these terms are outdated, offensive, or\n              insensitive.</li>\n            <li>Communities with less access to and privilege within libraries\n              and archives have had less control over how they are represented\n              and described.</li>\n            <li>Librarians and archivists sometimes make mistakes or use poor\n              judgement.</li>\n            <li>DPLA is committed to working with its partners to assess and\n              update descriptions that are harmful.</li>\n          </ul>\n\n\n\n          <h4>How are librarians and archivists working to address this problem\n            and help users better understand such content?</h4>\n\n\n\n          <p>Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n          <ul>\n            <li>Working directly with misrepresented and underrepresented\n              communities to improve the ways they are represented.</li>\n            <li>Informing users about the presence and origin of harmful\n              content.</li>\n            <li>Revising descriptions and standardized sets of descriptive\n              terms, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings, supplementing\n              description with more respectful terms, or creating new\n              standardized terms to describe materials.</li>\n            <li>Researching the problem, listening to users, experimenting with\n              solutions, and sharing our findings with each other.</li>\n            <li>Evaluating existing collecting and digitization policies for\n              exclusionary practices and institutional biases that prioritize\n              one culture and/or group over another.</li>\n            <li>Making an institutional commitment to DEIA (diversity, equity,\n              inclusion, and accessibility).

(“DPLA”). Our mission is to\n            make cultural and scientific works more accessible to the public.\n            Through the dp.la website (the “Website”), as well as any other\n            applications, functionality, or services delivered to you by DPLA\n            (collectively with the Website, the “Services”), users can search\n            for works held by libraries, museums, archives, and other content\n            aggregators across the country (“Content Partners”). DPLA does this\n            by maintaining a large searchable database of metadata provided to\n            DPLA by its Content Partners (the “Metadata”). In addition, DPLA has\n            collaborated with some of its Content Partners and others to deliver\n            curated content to users of the Services (the “Exhibitions” and\n            “Primary Source Sets”). The goal of the Exhibitions and Primary\n            Source Sets is to pull together thematically driven text and images\n            in order to provide enriching material to our visitors. We hope you\n            enjoy your visit with DPLA and the use of our Services, and look\n            forward to unveiling more features as we continue to grow. Before\n            you use the Services, please read the following terms and conditions\n            (the “Terms of Service”), which govern your use of the Services.</p>\n          <h3>Terms of Service</h3>\n          <p>These Terms of Service constitute an agreement between you and\n            DPLA.

General Terms</h4>\n          <h5>12.1. Updates and Changes to These Terms of Service</h5>\n          <p>DPLA reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at anytime\n            at its discretion. If DPLA does make changes to this privacy policy,\n            DPLA will update this page accordingly. Please check this page\n            periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Services\n            after this page is updated with the new terms signifies your\n            acceptance of the amended Terms of Service. No amendment to these\n            Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of\n            which DPLA had actual notice before the date of the amendment. Other\n            additional terms may apply to other functions or components of the\n            Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and\n            the other additional terms, the other additional terms will govern.\n          </p>\n          <h5>12.2. Entire Agreement</h5>\n          <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the\n            parties, and supersede all previous agreements relating to the use\n            of the Services.</p>\n          <h5>12.3. Applicable Law and Forum</h5>\n          <p>These Terms of Service and any referenced policies or guidelines\n            are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the\n            Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of\n            conflict of law. If you bring a suit against DPLA, you hereby\n            consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts in\n            Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and hereby consent to the personal\n            jurisdiction of said courts.</p>\n          <h5>12.4. Location of Services</h5>\n          <p>The Services are controlled and offered by DPLA from its facilities\n            in the United States. DPLA makes no representations that the\n            Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.\n            Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so\n            at their own volition and are responsible for complying with local\n            law.</p>\n          <h5>12.5. Severability</h5>\n          <p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed to be\n            unenforceable for any reason by any court, the invalidity of this\n            provision does not affect the validity of any other provisions in\n            these Terms of Service, which remain in full effect.</p>\n          <h5>12.6. Language of the Terms of Service</h5>\n          <p>If DPLA provides you with a translation of the English version of\n            these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or any other policy,\n            then you agree that the translation is provided for informational\n            purposes only and does not modify the English-language version. In\n            the event of a conflict between a translation and the English\n            version, the English version will govern.</p>\n          <h5>12.7. Site Source Code</h5>\n          <p>DPLA makes some of its source code related to the Services\n            available under the&nbsp;<a\n              href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html\"\n              class=\"external\">GNU Affero General Public License</a>.

No Waiver</h5>\n          <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a\n            further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and\n            DPLA’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of\n            Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Questions?</h3>\n          <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please <a\n              href=\"/contact\">contact DPLA</a>.</p>\n          <p><strong>Last modified on May&nbsp;3, 2016.</strong></p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"

This privacy policy\n            describes how DPLA uses, collects, and shares information through\n            the Services.</p>\n          <h3>1. What types of information does DPLA collect?</h3>\n          <h4>1.1. Usage Data</h4>\n          <p>As with most services, DPLA may automatically collect certain\n            information when you use the Services, even when you are not logged\n            in. DPLA collects this information when you access the Services,\n            including when you set up an account, upload information, or browse,\n            read, or download information from the Services. This type of\n            information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, URL\n            request, browser type, and the date and time of a request. DPLA may\n            use cookies or other automated mechanisms to collect this\n            information and may collect this information on an aggregate or\n            individual basis. Cookies are small text files that the Services can\n            send to your browser for storage on your computer. They make use of\n            the Website easier by saving your status and preferences and\n            refreshing them every time you use the Website. For instance, to\n            facilitate registration and login functions, DPLA may use cookies to\n            recognize when you return to the Website so that you do not have to\n            resubmit your logon credentials. In order to clear this logon\n            information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log\n            out of your account. While many browsers allow you to change your\n            settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies\n            are being sent, it is recommended that you leave cookies enabled, as\n            disabling cookies may interfere with some functionality of the\n            Services.</p>\n          <h4>1.2. Personal Information</h4>\n          <p>In order to access certain parts of the Services, DPLA may require\n            you to provide personal information, such as your email address.\n            DPLA uses this information to manage your account, communicate with\n            you, and provide the Services to you. DPLA will not collect any\n            personal information from your use of the Services unless you choose\n            to provide it by registering for an account or otherwise posting,\n            sending, or uploading the information to the Services.</p>\n          <h4>1.3. User Content that You Post to the Services</h4>\n          <p>Certain parts of the Services allow you to upload or post comments\n            or other content (“User Content”). Likewise, the Services also allow\n            registered users to save searches (“Saved Searches”) and to save and\n            share lists of items found through the Services (“Saved Lists”). You\n            may post User Content or create Saved Searches or Saved Lists at\n            your discretion. Please note that User Content that you post or\n            provide through the Services may be publicly available, viewable to\n            others, and may appear in search results on third-party search\n            engines. Likewise, if you choose to make your Saved Searches or\n            Saved Lists public, they will be publicly available, viewable to\n            others, and may appear in search results on third-party search\n            engines. DPLA recommends that you do not post any personal\n            information, such as your address, social security number, or other\n            personal information, as that information may be publicly displayed\n            and seen by others.</p>\n          <h3>2. How does DPLA Use the Information It Collects?</h3>\n          <p>DPLA uses the information that it collects to deliver and improve\n            the Services, administer mailing lists and online communities, and\n            other activities related to the provision of the Services. DPLA may\n            retain all data and content collected through the Services for\n            restorative, archival, or research purposes. Editing or deleting\n            your User Content will alter the public availability of the User\n            Content, but may not permanently delete the content from the\n            Services.</p>\n          <h3>3. When does DPLA disclose information to third parties?</h3>\n          <p>DPLA uses third party services providers, such as web analytics\n            providers, infrastructure providers, and other similar providers, to\n            help deliver the Services. DPLA may share the information it\n            collects through the Services with these service providers as\n            necessary to provide or improve the Services. DPLA may also share\n            certain information it collects with its research partners. In\n            addition, although DPLA will not publicly share personal information\n            unless you choose to make that information public, DPLA may publicly\n            share aggregated data or statistics related to the Services that may\n            include anonymized user information or usage statistics. Finally,\n            DPLA may share information when responding to a request from law\n            enforcement, or to prevent malicious use of the Services. In the\n            event that DPLA is required by law to disclose any information\n            related to your account, DPLA will use reasonable efforts to provide\n            you with notice of the request by email, unless DPLA is prohibited\n            by law or government order from doing so. DPLA will not sell\n            information it collects or stores through the Services to any third\n            parties for monetary compensation.</p>\n          <h3>4. What if I access another website or third party service through\n            the Services?</h3>\n          <p>DPLA may link you to or provide you access to services or websites\n            offered by third parties, such as libraries, museums, archives,\n            Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other similar services. Please note\n            that this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of those\n            third parties, and DPLA is not responsible for the privacy practices\n            of those third parties. Please make sure you are comfortable with\n            the privacy practices of these third parties before using their\n            services.</p>\n          <h3>5. Security</h3>\n          <p>DPLA has taken efforts to put security measures in place to protect\n            information and data that is collected through the Services.\n            However, DPLA cannot guarantee or warrant that any information\n            collected through the Services will remain confidential, and many\n            functions of the Services are intended to make information and\n            content publicly available. You are responsible for setting and\n            maintaining the security of your password. DPLA may not keep a copy\n            of your password, so please safeguard the password associated with\n            your account and do not share your password with third parties.</p>\n          <h3>6. Transfer of Information</h3>\n          <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers\n            and databases located outside of your state, province, country or\n            other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as\n            protective as your jurisdiction. Please be advised that we may\n            transfer your information to and from any state, province, country\n            or other governmental jurisdiction, and process it in the United\n            States or elsewhere. By using the Services, you consent to any such\n            transfer of your information.</p>\n          <h3>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>\n          <p>DPLA reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time\n            at its discretion. If DPLA does make changes to this privacy policy,\n            DPLA will update this page accordingly. Please check this page\n            periodically for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this\n            privacy policy, terms used in this privacy policy have the same\n            meanings as in the <a href=\"/about/terms-conditions\">Terms of\n              Service</a>.</p>\n          <h3>Questions?</h3>\n          <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please <a\n              href=\"/contact\">contact DPLA</a>.</p>\n          <p><strong>Last modified on April 15, 2013.</strong></p>\n          <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
