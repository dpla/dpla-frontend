          <p>
            The Digital Public Library of America amplifies the value of
            libraries and cultural organizations as Americans’ most trusted
            sources of shared knowledge. We do this by collaborating with
            partners to accelerate innovative tools and ideas that empower and
            equip libraries to make information more accessible.
          </p>
          <p>We work with a national network of partners to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make millions of materials from libraries, archives, museums, and
              other cultural institutions across the country available to all in
              a one-stop discovery experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a library-controlled marketplace and platform for
              libraries to purchase, organize, and deliver ebooks and other
              e-content to their patrons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Convene library leaders and practitioners to explore and advance
              technologies that serve, inform, and empower their communities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What is DPLA?</h2>
          <p>
            The Digital Public Library of America amplifies the value of
            libraries and cultural organizations as Americans’ most trusted
            sources of shared knowledge. We do this by collaborating with
            partners to accelerate innovative tools and ideas that empower and
            equip libraries to make information more accessible.
          </p>
          <p>We work with a national network of partners to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make millions of materials from libraries, archives, museums, and
              other cultural institutions across the country available to all in
              a one-stop discovery experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a library-controlled marketplace and platform for
              libraries to purchase, organize, and deliver ebooks and other
              e-content to their patrons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Convene library leaders and practitioners to explore and advance
              technologies that serve, inform, and empower their communities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>
            Do you provide the same sorts of services that my local library
            does?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We are always happy to answer questions about how to use DPLA or
            discover relevant material in our collections, but we do not offer
            universal reference services like you might find in your local
            library (i.e., assistance with questions pertaining to municipal and
            federal services, the law, résumé help, and so forth). For more
            information about ongoing DPLA initiatives, such as our hub network
            and our ebooks work, visit <a href="http://pro.dp.la">DPLA Pro</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Do you have physical copies of your items?</h2>
          <p>
            No, DPLA is an all-digital library that aggregates metadata from
            libraries, museums and institutions around the country. We provide
            an easy to use search interface so you can get the power that comes
            with searching millions of records at once. If you need a physical
            copy of an item, please get in touch with the contributing
            institution, which you can find listed on an item page below the
            thumbnail image.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>How do I find what I’m looking for?</h2>
          <p>
            Check out our <a href="/about/search-tips">Search Tips</a> for more
            on how to explore DPLA.
          </p>
          <h2>Do I need a library card?</h2>
          <p>No, DPLA doesn’t require any sign up to use.</p>
          <h2>Do you answer reference questions?</h2>
          <p>
            We’re always happy to answer questions about how to use DPLA or
            discover relevant material in our collections, but we do not offer
            all of the universal reference services like you might find in your
            local library.
          </p>
          <h2>Does DPLA have a mobile app?</h2>
          <p>No. However, DPLA’s website is responsive and mobile-friendly.</p>
          <hr />
          <h2>What’s the deal with copyright and a DPLA item?</h2>
          <p>
            The copyright status of items in DPLA varies. DPLA links to a wide
            variety of different materials: many are in the public domain, while
            others are under rights restrictions but nonetheless publicly
            viewable. For individual rights information about an item, please
            check the “Rights” field in the metadata, or follow the link to the
            digital object on the content provider’s website for more
            information.
          </p>
          <h2>What are those icons on a DPLA record?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="http://rightsstatements.org" class="external"
              >Rights Statements</a
            >
            icons are part of a new endeavor, developed in collaboration with
            Europeana, to clearly communicate the copyright status of items
            available on our site. We will be working with our content providers
            to attach a standardized rights statement, and accompanying icon, to
            each of our records. This makes it a streamlined experience for you,
            our users — you’ll be able to tell, by a glance, whether or not a
            particular item is available to re-use.
          </p>
          <h2>
            I want to secure rights to a particular DPLA item. Whom should I
            email about that?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Please do not contact DPLA directly about item specific permissions
            — you must contact the institution that provided the content to
            DPLA. Each metadata record in DPLA contains a link to the item on
            the content provider’s website.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>How does DPLA get content?</h2>
          <p>
            We work with organizations (called Hubs) around the country to add
            content to our collection. Visit the
            <a href="https://pro.dp.la/hubs">Hub Network</a> page on DPLA Pro to
            l<span style="font-weight: 400;"

            </span>
          </p>
          <h2>Can I contribute content to DPLA?</h2>
          <p>
            DPLA only accepts content through our Hubs, including Service Hubs
            that bring content together from libraries, archives and museums,
            and other cultural heritage institutions in a state or
            region.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;"
              >If you are interested in partnering with a Service Hub to share

          <h2>What is metadata?</h2>
          <p>
            Metadata is information that enables users to discover, identify,
            interpret, or manage content. For example, metadata may include the
            title of an item, the name of the creator of the work, the date on
            which it was first created or published, or where the physical
            object is located. Metadata in DPLA may also contain a brief
            description that provides information about the historical and
            cultural context of an item. Each of our metadata records also
            include a link that directs you to the item on the contributor’s
            website.
          </p>
          <h2>
            I have a bunch of other questions about your metadata model or Hub
            network. Can you help me?

          <h2>What technologies does DPLA use?</h2>
          <p>
            We’re a firm believer in open source technology, both in terms of
            use and our open source code which is available on
            <a href="http://github.com/dpla" class="external">Github</a>.

          <h2>Can I use your code?</h2>
          <p>
            All of the software that DPLA has developed — the ingestion code,
            platform, portal, and exhibitions — is available under open source
            licenses.
          </p>
          <h2>Is DPLA accessible?</h2>
          <p>
            DPLA follows open web standards and follows best practice
            accessibility guidelines. If you notice anything awry, or wish for
            more information, contact us at

          </p>
          <h2>DPLA gets blocked on my network. Why is that?</h2>
          <p>
            DPLA uses an unconventional URL which may be blocked by some
            filters. Get in touch with your network administrator if that’s the
            case, and ask them to whitelist dp.la. If you have issues,

        <h1>DPLA’s Statement on Potentially Harmful Content</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a portal to millions
            of freely available items from thousands of libraries, archives,
            museums, and other cultural heritage organizations across the United
            States.
          </p>

          <p>
            DPLA contains some content that may be harmful or difficult to view.
            Our cultural heritage partners collect materials from history, as
            well as artifacts from many cultures and time periods, to preserve
            and make available the historical record. As a result, some of the
            materials presented here may reflect outdated, biased, offensive,
            and possibly violent views and opinions due to pervasive systemic
            intolerance. In addition, some cultural heritage institutions
            collect and preserve materials relating to violent or graphic events
            which are preserved for their historical significance.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>

          <h4>Where does this content come from?</h4>

          <p>
            Digital Public Library of America collects and makes freely
            available materials from more than 4,000 libraries, archives,
            museums, and other cultural heritage organizations across the United
            States. Each institution or contributor shares materials with the
            DPLA according to its specific policies and objectives. DPLA
            aggregates this digital content, which means the portal points back
            to partner’s organizations websites where the items are hosted.
          </p>

              reflect white supremacist and American imperialist ideologies,
              which include racist, sexist, misogynistic/misogynoir, and

              demonstrate bias and exclusion in institutional collecting and
              digitization policies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Why does DPLA make potentially harmful content available?</h4>

          <p>
            DPLA and its partners collect, preserve, and present these materials
            as part of the historic record, which does include depictions and
            records of people experiencing trauma and harm. Librarians and
            archivists working in conjunction with DPLA seek to balance the
            preservation of this history with sensitivity to how these materials
            are presented to and perceived by users.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <strong
              >How is this material described, and why are some of the terms
              used in the descriptions harmful?&nbsp;</strong
            >
          </h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Librarians and archivists choose what language to use when
              describing materials. Some of these descriptions were written many
              years ago, using language that was accepted at the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Librarians and archivists often re-use language provided by
              creators or former owners of the material. This can provide
              important context, but can also reflect biases and prejudices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Librarians and archivists often use a standardized set of terms,
              such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, to describe
              materials.&nbsp; Some of these terms are outdated, offensive, or
              insensitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communities with less access to and privilege within libraries and
              archives have had less control over how they are represented and
              described.
            </li>
            <li>
              Librarians and archivists sometimes make mistakes or use poor
              judgement.
            </li>
            <li>
              DPLA is committed to working with its partners to assess and
              update descriptions that are harmful.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>
            How are librarians and archivists working to address this problem
            and help users better understand such content?
          </h4>

          <p>Examples include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Working directly with misrepresented and underrepresented
              communities to improve the ways they are represented.
            </li>
            <li>
              Informing users about the presence and origin of harmful content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revising descriptions and standardized sets of descriptive terms,
              such as Library of Congress Subject Headings, supplementing
              description with more respectful terms, or creating new
              standardized terms to describe materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Researching the problem, listening to users, experimenting with
              solutions, and sharing our findings with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluating existing collecting and digitization policies for
              exclusionary practices and institutional biases that prioritize
              one culture and/or group over another.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making an institutional commitment to DEIA (diversity, equity,
              inclusion, and accessibility). Examples of this work can be found
              in the

          <h4><strong>How can I report harmful content?</strong></h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              You can help us understand this issue and find solutions by

                >reporting harmful content</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              DPLA will forward your report to the institution(s) that are
              responsible for the content and make it available through
              DPLA.&nbsp; It is up to each individual institution to determine
              whether or not they will change or remove the content.&nbsp;
              Institutions weigh potential harm against considerations such as
              accurate preservation of the historical record, professional best
              practices, and allocation of scarce resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              DPLA will use all reports of harmful content to better understand
              the issue and educate other librarians and archivists.
            </li>

        <h1>Search Tips</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>Searching for items in DPLA</h2>
          <p>
            Type whatever you’re looking for—a subject, a name, a place—into the
            search box at the top of any page on the DPLA website and either
            click the magnifying glass to the right or hit return/enter on your
            keyboard.
          </p>
          <h2>How to explore/refine/navigate your search results</h2>
          <p>
            DPLA search returns results sorted by relevance. You can change how
            you see search results in a number of ways:
          </p>
          <h3>Refine</h3>
          <p>
            DPLA lets you refine your search by type, subject, location, date,
            and language. The menus on the left side of the search results page
            display all of the types, subjects, locations, dates, and languages
            among your search results.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also filter items by Contributing Institution and by
            Partner. A Contributing Institution is a library, archive, museum,
            or other cultural heritage institution that contributes metadata
            from its digital collections via a Hub to DPLA. A partner
            organization, or Hub, &nbsp;provides essential services and content
            directly to DPLA.
          </p>
          <h3>Display</h3>
          <p>
            You can view 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page by selecting your
            preference from the “Items per page” drop-down menu.
          </p>
          <h3>Sort order</h3>
          <p>
            By default, DPLA sorts search results by relevance to your search
            term(s). You can sort alphabetically or by date by choosing a
            different sort order from the “Sort by” drop-down menu.
          </p>
          <h2>How to further narrow your search results</h2>
          <p>
            You can change the way you enter your search term to create more
            specific results.
          </p>
          <h3>Exact phrases</h3>
          <p>
            You can search for an exact phrase by enclosing it in quotation
            marks.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>"dog shows"</code></dt>
            <dd>returns items with the exact phrase “dog shows”</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Boolean operators</h3>
          <p>
            You can combine multiple terms using OR and NOT operators. &nbsp;The
            default behavior when searching multiple terms is boolean AND.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>dog OR cat</code></dt>
            <dt><code>dog || cat</code></dt>
            <dd>returns items with either dog or cat</dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>dog NOT cat</code></dt>
            <dt><code>dog -cat</code></dt>
            <dd>returns items with dog and without cat</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Wildcards</h3>
          <p>
            Use an asterisk (*) as a substitute for any collection of characters
            within a word.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>dog*</code></dt>
            <dd>returns items with the words dog, dogs, doggy, dogged, etc.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Keywords</h3>
          <p>
            An item’s title or description may contain another word for your
            search term. Try synonyms for your search term, and think about more
            specific or broader words that describe your term
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>dog</code></dt>
            <dd>Also try: pup, puppy, hound, canine, pet</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            Combine with Boolean operators to continue refining your search.
          </p>

            Fair Use (Section 107) is a provision of the<a

            public interest in the discovery and production of new works against
            the rights of the creator of a work. Some rights statements or

          <h2 id="usingthesets">Using the Primary Source Sets</h2>

          <p>Try one of these implementation ideas or create your own!<br /></p>

          <p>
            <strong>What’s missing?<br /></strong>There is always room for new
            ideas or perspectives on a topic! Students can critically examine
            the sources in a set and identify an item from DPLA that they would
            add to that set. Students can also generate new discussion questions
            to add to the set’s teaching guide using the sources.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Gamify the sets</strong><br />Use sources from the sets to
            create an educational game or challenge for students. For example,
            build a Digital Breakout in which answers to each question can be
            uncovered through primary source analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Storytelling with sources</strong><br />Ask students to
            generate a narrative using a set of sources from the sets as
            evidence. Follow up with a class discussion comparing the ways each
            student or group used the sources.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Do students or schools have to subscribe, login, or pay?</strong
            ><br />Nope! All of DPLA’s collections and resources are freely
            available to all – no login or subscription required.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Are the Primary Source Sets aligned to state or national
              standards?</strong
            ><br />The sets are designed to be adaptable across grade levels and
            a broad range of classroom environments so we did not explicitly
            align them to specific state or national standards. We did use
            curriculum guidelines as a reference when selecting topics to make
            sure the sets reflect commonly-taught topics and skills.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Are the Primary Source Sets Open Educational Resources?</strong
            ><br />The Primary Source Sets are Open Educational Resources (OER)
            in that they are freely available for educators and students to use,
            reuse, and adapt for educational purposes. The sets are made
            available under the
            <a

              class="external"
              >CC BY 3.0 License</a
            >. However, not all of the individual items within the sets are
            copyright-free and may have restrictions for downloading, sharing,
            or publishing elsewhere.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Are the Primary Source Sets printable?</strong><br />The
            sets are designed to be used online, so the source pages are not
            formatted for printing. Each set’s teaching guide can be easily
            printed using the “Print this Guide” link.<br />

            The Digital Public Library of America is a project managed by
            Digital Public Library of America, Inc. (“DPLA”). Our mission is to
            make cultural and scientific works more accessible to the public.
            Through the dp.la website (the “Website”), as well as any other
            applications, functionality, or services delivered to you by DPLA
            (collectively with the Website, the “Services”), users can search
            for works held by libraries, museums, archives, and other content
            aggregators across the country (“Content Partners”). DPLA does this
            by maintaining a large searchable database of metadata provided to
            DPLA by its Content Partners (the “Metadata”). In addition, DPLA has
            collaborated with some of its Content Partners and others to deliver
            curated content to users of the Services (the “Exhibitions” and
            “Primary Source Sets”). The goal of the Exhibitions and Primary
            Source Sets is to pull together thematically driven text and images
            in order to provide enriching material to our visitors. We hope you
            enjoy your visit with DPLA and the use of our Services, and look
            forward to unveiling more features as we continue to grow. Before
            you use the Services, please read the following terms and conditions
            (the “Terms of Service”), which govern your use of the Services.
          </p>
          <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service constitute an agreement between you and DPLA.
            By using or accessing any portion of the Services you agree to be
            bound by these Terms of Service, so please read these terms
            carefully before using or accessing Services. If you do not agree to
            and accept these Terms of Service, please do not register for an
            account or use the Services in any manner. All individuals who
            access or otherwise use the Services, including casual visitors to
            the Website, are referred to in these Terms of Service as “Users.”
          </p>
          <h4>1. Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p>
            DPLA respects your privacy. How DPLA uses, collects, and stores data
            is governed by the
            <a href="/about/privacy-policy">DPLA Privacy Policy</a>. Please read
            the&nbsp;<a href="/about/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a
            >&nbsp;carefully before using any of the Services. By using the
            Services, you indicate that you understand and consent to the
            collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in
            DPLA’s&nbsp;<a href="/about/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Account Creation</h4>
          <p>
            In order to use some features of the Services, such as saving
            searches, and saving and sharing lists of items found through the
            Services, you will need to register with DPLA and create an account.
            When registering, you will be asked to provide certain personal
            information, such as your email address. Please see DPLA’s&nbsp;<a
              href="/about/privacy-policy"
              >Privacy Policy</a
            >&nbsp;for DPLA’s data-retention and usage policies. You agree not
            to create an account using false or misleading information or on
            behalf of someone other than yourself. Any accounts created using
            intentionally misleading information are subject to termination at
            DPLA’s sole discretion. Please note that using a pseudonym on the
            Services would not violate this provision. If you have been banned
            or had your account revoked at any time, you may not register for
            another account.
          </p>

              any applicable laws, statutes, or regulations, infringes or
              violates any other person or entity’s rights, or that DPLA, in its
              sole discretion, finds to be obscene or defamatory.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              You may not use the Services in any way that interferes with the
              operation of the Services or impacts or harasses any other User,
              host, or network, or circumvents any of the Services’ security
              protections.

            question, you may appeal the removal by sending an email or written
            notice to DPLA’s designated agent with the following information:

            failure to comply with the these Terms of Service or those of a
            third party, for repeated violations of third-party rights, for
            actual or suspected illegal or improper use of the Services, for
            offensive User Content or conduct, or for technical reasons.

            IN NO EVENT IS DPLA, OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR

          </p>
          <h4>12. General Terms</h4>
          <h5>12.1. Updates and Changes to These Terms of Service</h5>
          <p>
            DPLA reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at anytime
            at its discretion. If DPLA does make changes to this privacy policy,
            DPLA will update this page accordingly. Please check this page
            periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Services
            after this page is updated with the new terms signifies your
            acceptance of the amended Terms of Service. No amendment to these
            Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of
            which DPLA had actual notice before the date of the amendment. Other
            additional terms may apply to other functions or components of the
            Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and
            the other additional terms, the other additional terms will govern.
          </p>
          <h5>12.2. Entire Agreement</h5>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the
            parties, and supersede all previous agreements relating to the use
            of the Services.
          </p>
          <h5>12.3. Applicable Law and Forum</h5>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service and any referenced policies or guidelines are
            governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
            Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of
            conflict of law. If you bring a suit against DPLA, you hereby
            consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts in
            Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and hereby consent to the personal
            jurisdiction of said courts.
          </p>
          <h5>12.4. Location of Services</h5>
          <p>
            The Services are controlled and offered by DPLA from its facilities
            in the United States. DPLA makes no representations that the
            Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
            Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so
            at their own volition and are responsible for complying with local
            law.
          </p>
          <h5>12.5. Severability</h5>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed to be
            unenforceable for any reason by any court, the invalidity of this
            provision does not affect the validity of any other provisions in
            these Terms of Service, which remain in full effect.
          </p>
          <h5>12.6. Language of the Terms of Service</h5>
          <p>
            If DPLA provides you with a translation of the English version of
            these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or any other policy,
            then you agree that the translation is provided for informational
            purposes only and does not modify the English-language version. In
            the event of a conflict between a translation and the English
            version, the English version will govern.
          </p>
          <h5>12.7. Site Source Code</h5>
          <p>
            DPLA makes some of its source code related to the Services available
            under the&nbsp;<a
              href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html"

            >.
          </p>
          <h5>12.8. No Waiver</h5>
          <p>
            No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a
            further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and
            DPLA’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of
            Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Digital Public Library of America (“DPLA”) is committed to
            preserving your privacy and being transparent about how DPLA uses
            information collected through the dp.la website (the “Website”) and
            any other applications, functionality or services offered by DPLA
            (collectively with the Website, the “Services”). This privacy policy
            describes how DPLA uses, collects, and shares information through
            the Services.
          </p>
          <h3>1. What types of information does DPLA collect?</h3>
          <h4>1.1. Usage Data</h4>
          <p>
            As with most services, DPLA may automatically collect certain
            information when you use the Services, even when you are not logged
            in. DPLA collects this information when you access the Services,
            including when you set up an account, upload information, or browse,
            read, or download information from the Services. This type of
            information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, URL
            request, browser type, and the date and time of a request. DPLA may
            use cookies or other automated mechanisms to collect this
            information and may collect this information on an aggregate or
            individual basis. Cookies are small text files that the Services can
            send to your browser for storage on your computer. They make use of
            the Website easier by saving your status and preferences and
            refreshing them every time you use the Website. For instance, to
            facilitate registration and login functions, DPLA may use cookies to
            recognize when you return to the Website so that you do not have to
            resubmit your logon credentials. In order to clear this logon
            information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log
            out of your account. While many browsers allow you to change your
            settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies
            are being sent, it is recommended that you leave cookies enabled, as
            disabling cookies may interfere with some functionality of the
            Services.
          </p>
          <h4>1.2. Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            In order to access certain parts of the Services, DPLA may require
            you to provide personal information, such as your email address.
            DPLA uses this information to manage your account, communicate with
            you, and provide the Services to you. DPLA will not collect any
            personal information from your use of the Services unless you choose
            to provide it by registering for an account or otherwise posting,
            sending, or uploading the information to the Services.
          </p>
          <h4>1.3. User Content that You Post to the Services</h4>
          <p>
            Certain parts of the Services allow you to upload or post comments
            or other content (“User Content”). Likewise, the Services also allow
            registered users to save searches (“Saved Searches”) and to save and
            share lists of items found through the Services (“Saved Lists”). You
            may post User Content or create Saved Searches or Saved Lists at
            your discretion. Please note that User Content that you post or
            provide through the Services may be publicly available, viewable to
            others, and may appear in search results on third-party search
            engines. Likewise, if you choose to make your Saved Searches or
            Saved Lists public, they will be publicly available, viewable to
            others, and may appear in search results on third-party search
            engines. DPLA recommends that you do not post any personal
            information, such as your address, social security number, or other
            personal information, as that information may be publicly displayed
            and seen by others.
          </p>
          <h3>2. How does DPLA Use the Information It Collects?</h3>
          <p>
            DPLA uses the information that it collects to deliver and improve
            the Services, administer mailing lists and online communities, and
            other activities related to the provision of the Services. DPLA may
            retain all data and content collected through the Services for
            restorative, archival, or research purposes. Editing or deleting
            your User Content will alter the public availability of the User
            Content, but may not permanently delete the content from the
            Services.
          </p>
          <h3>3. When does DPLA disclose information to third parties?</h3>
          <p>
            DPLA uses third party services providers, such as web analytics
            providers, infrastructure providers, and other similar providers, to
            help deliver the Services. DPLA may share the information it
            collects through the Services with these service providers as
            necessary to provide or improve the Services. DPLA may also share
            certain information it collects with its research partners. In
            addition, although DPLA will not publicly share personal information
            unless you choose to make that information public, DPLA may publicly
            share aggregated data or statistics related to the Services that may
            include anonymized user information or usage statistics. Finally,
            DPLA may share information when responding to a request from law
            enforcement, or to prevent malicious use of the Services. In the
            event that DPLA is required by law to disclose any information
            related to your account, DPLA will use reasonable efforts to provide
            you with notice of the request by email, unless DPLA is prohibited
            by law or government order from doing so. DPLA will not sell
            information it collects or stores through the Services to any third
            parties for monetary compensation.
          </p>
          <h3>
            4. What if I access another website or third party service through
            the Services?
          </h3>
          <p>
            DPLA may link you to or provide you access to services or websites
            offered by third parties, such as libraries, museums, archives,
            Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other similar services. Please note
            that this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of those
            third parties, and DPLA is not responsible for the privacy practices
            of those third parties. Please make sure you are comfortable with
            the privacy practices of these third parties before using their
            services.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Security</h3>
          <p>
            DPLA has taken efforts to put security measures in place to protect
            information and data that is collected through the Services.
            However, DPLA cannot guarantee or warrant that any information
            collected through the Services will remain confidential, and many
            functions of the Services are intended to make information and
            content publicly available. You are responsible for setting and
            maintaining the security of your password. DPLA may not keep a copy
            of your password, so please safeguard the password associated with
            your account and do not share your password with third parties.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Transfer of Information</h3>
          <p>
            Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers and
            databases located outside of your state, province, country or other
            governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
            protective as your jurisdiction. Please be advised that we may
            transfer your information to and from any state, province, country
            or other governmental jurisdiction, and process it in the United
            States or elsewhere. By using the Services, you consent to any such
            transfer of your information.
          </p>
          <h3>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            DPLA reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time at
            its discretion. If DPLA does make changes to this privacy policy,
            DPLA will update this page accordingly. Please check this page
            periodically for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this
            privacy policy, terms used in this privacy policy have the same
            meanings as in the
