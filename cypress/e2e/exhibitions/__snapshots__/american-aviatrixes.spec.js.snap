              ground in ways never before possible, and the sky literally became
              the limit. As the nation moved into the aviation age, many women
              saw flying as a way to break out of traditional societal roles. It
              gave women not just an opportunity for adventure and excitement,
              but a way to earn a living outside of the home that demanded
              respect.</span

              cross-country distance record: "There is an indescribable feeling
              which one experiences in flying; it comes with no other form of
              sport or navigation. It takes courage and daring; one must be
              self-possessed, for there are moments when one's wits are tested
              to the full. Yet there is an exhilaration that compensates for all
              one's efforts."</span

                along the way.

                fly, there remained some debate over whether these or
                monoplanes—with one set of wings that mimicked birds—would come

                plane engines were low-powered, causing drag that made it
                difficult to gain much altitude. Many of the early monoplanes
                failed, with the fragile, wooden wings folding up as soon as
                they lifted off the ground.</span

                monoplanes, which often flew much faster than biplanes because
                they had less drag. However, Bléroit’s planes did not perform
                consistently: they often failed along with other early monoplane
                designs.</span

                  design. This included the use of cantilevered wings, which are
                  anchored on just one end and still in use today. This type of
                  wing reduces the weight of the plane, and increases speed and
                  efficiency. Other improvements included metal-skinned wings
                  and more powerful engines. It was during this era, leading up
                  to and including WWI, that women became part of aviation’s
                  development.

                >In 1911, Harriet Quimby, a drama critic and editor for the
                <em>Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly</em>, became the first woman to
                get her pilot’s license in the US, from the Aero Club of
                America. Although Quimby only flew for eleven months after
                receiving her license, she accomplished a lot during her time in
                the pilot’s seat. In addition to being the first woman to fly a
                plane at night, she also flew across the English Channel, and at
                the inauguration festivities for Mexico’s president-elect in
                1911. She did it all wearing a custom-made purple satin flight
                suit—a visible symbol of her femininity in the male-dominated
                aviation world. Quimby planned to be the first woman to fly mail
                from Boston to New York, but died in a tragic accident while
                taking her plane for a test flight in July of 1912.</span

                  >Shortly after Quimby received her pilot’s license, her friend
                  Matilde Moisant became the second woman to obtain the
                  certification from the Aero Club. Like Quimby, she learned to
                  fly at the Moisant Aviation School, which was run by her
                  brother. She quickly became a skilled pilot. By September
                  1911, she had won the Rodman-Wanamaker altitude trophy.
                  Shortly thereafter, Moisant stopped flying at the request of
                  her family (and possibly because of Quimby’s untimely death)
                  after her aircraft burst into flames and she herself was set
                  afire. Though not seriously injured in the accident, she
                  retired from flying in 1912.

                >In the early 1940s in the midst of World War II, more than
                1,000 women left their homes for an opportunity to help their
                country by flying the skies. Under the command of Nancy Harkness
                Love and the direction of Jacqueline Cochran, they became the
                first licensed women pilots to fly in the United States Air
                Force Service and were known as the Women Air Force Service
                Pilots (WASPs).</span

              <span
                >In 1939, Jacqueline Cochran wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt to
                introduce the idea of a women’s division in the Army Air Force.
                She saw qualified women pilots as an untapped resource that
                could be of great help in domestic, non-warfare jobs, and a way
                to free more male pilots for combat. The WASP program was
                originally established on August 5, 1943, with the approval of
                General Henry "Hap" Arnold, by merging Cochran's Women Flying
                Training Detachment (WFTD) and Love's Women’s Auxiliary Ferrying
                Squadron (WAFS).</span

              <span
                >The WASPs served in the Air Force, first as pilots who ferried
                planes, then as instructors, and finally by performing any job
                that would relieve men for combat. &nbsp;In the beginning, women
                enlisted for the opportunity to serve their country, but many
                stayed for the thrill of flying.</span

                >Although early aviatrixes broke both records and barriers
                during their time in the cockpit, it remained difficult for
                aspiring women pilots to get into the field after World War II.
                This was particularly true for women in the military. Despite
                the success of the WASP program, it wasn’t until 1976, more than
                thirty years after the end of WWII, that women could join the
                Air Force’s pilot training. Fighter pilot training would not
                open up to women until 1993. In 1974, Sally D. Woolfolk became
                the first female military pilot in the Army. That same year,
                Barbara Allen Rainey earned her wings, becoming the first woman
                pilot in the Navy.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Today, women make up about 19 percent of the Air Force and hold
                jobs in almost all fields of service. The number of female Air
                Force pilots, though, is still small. As of the end of 2014,
                women account for less than 700, or about 5 percent, of the
                approximately 13,000 Air Force pilots.</span

              <span
                >While women also hold a variety of jobs in the commercial
                flight industry, it is still a difficult field for female pilots
                to enter. Helen Richey became the first US woman commercial
                pilot in 1934, when she was hired by the now-defunct Central
                Airlines. Her career was short-lived. She was forced to resign
                ten months later by the all-male pilots’ union. Today, it’s
                estimated that there are around 4,000 women airline pilots
                worldwide—three percent of the total number of commercial pilots
                in the US and internationally.</span

                >Women’s pilot organizations, such as the Ninety-Nines (of which
                Amelia Earhart was a member and president) and the International
                Society for Women Airline Pilots, continue to advocate for the
                future of women in aviation.&nbsp;</span

                >After WWI, civil aviation greatly expanded. This was made
                possible by cheap surplus Curtiss JN-4 “Jenny”
                aircrafts—biplanes produced to train WWI pilots that were
                subsequently used by civilians post war. They were popularly
                used by pilots known as “barnstormers” who would wow people with
                stunts at air shows across the country. Barnstorming pilots also
                offered joyrides, which introduced riders to flying and brought
                the experience of aviation to rural areas.</span

                >Record-breaking flights, speed races around pylons in stadiums,
                and long-distance races captured the public imagination. The
                1929 Air Shows in Cleveland were attended by half a million
                people, excited by not just the stunts, but the possibility of
                seeing a crash. The ten-day spectacle included a grand parade
                kick-off and a three million dollar aviation exhibit, alongside
                blimp rides and parachuting demonstrations between races.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Many of those record-breakers in the 1930s were women pilots,
                now central figures of barnstorming shows and races. The
                formerly all-male cross-country races opened up to female
                competitors in 1936. In that first co-ed cross-country race,
                aviatrixes Louise Thaden and Blanche Noyes clocked in with the
                best times.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The popularity of these races and air shows spurred
                manufacturers to build even faster planes. There were also
                developments in navigation, formerly done only with maps and
                compasses. By the 1930s, pilots were aided by instruments based
                on gyroscopes or airspeed that calculated altitude, velocity,
                and heading.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Emergency landings were still a possibility that pilots had to
                plan for—they couldn't even count on making it to a runway. In
                some cases, a clearing had to do. When flying solo or just with
                a co-pilot, they needed to understand how their planes worked in
                case there weren't mechanics to address problems where they
                landed.</span

                powerful engine aircrafts with sleek design and fast performance
                like the P-51 Mustang. This fighter plane was built in
                collaboration with the British military. It escorted bombers
                like the B-17 “Flying Fortress” and the famous B-29&nbsp;on long
                range journeys. It outperformed many of the enemy aircrafts, but
                was able to attack ground targets with bombs and machine
                guns.</span

                >Aircraft advancement also led to the development of improved
                training aircrafts like the T-6 Texan, which was maneuverable,
                fast, and easy to repair. It contained bomb racks, blind flying
                instrumentation, fixed and flexible guns, and other devices used
                in fighter planes. Due to its versatility and real-feel
                equipment, this aircraft became a favorite amongst trainers and
                trainees alike. During WWII, these trainers and trainees notably
                included women, who became part of a United States Air Force
                Service women’s program.</span

                >Blanche Stuart Scott was already an accomplished automobile
                driver before she took an interest in flight. Scott was one of
                the first women to drive cross country, a trip that took over
                two months, and was made lengthier by the fact that there were
                only 218 miles of paved road in the United States at the
                time.</span

            <p>
              Nicknamed “Tomboy of the Air,” Scott may have been the first woman
              to fly solo in an airplane. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the historical
              records of her flights are unclear. Conflicting reports suggest
              that she either took off in Hammondsport, New York, in August or
              September of 1910, or in October 1910 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. At
              the time, she was taking lessons with Glenn Curtiss, a well-known
              airplane manufacturer.

            <p>
              <span
                >She never obtained a pilot's license, so she was unable to fly
                on the East Coast of the United States. She decided to go west
                to California in 1912, where there was no license requirement.
                She took an interest in flying exhibitions and was known for
                doing “death dives” from up to 4,000 feet. By 1916, she decided
                to retire from flight when she found that the crowds were more
                interested in crashes than the flying itself. She moved to
                Hollywood and had a career in film and radio before being hired
                as a consultant for the Air Force Museum at Wright Patterson Air
                Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.</span

                career as an aviatrix, one of her greatest achievements was
                setting the cross-country distance record for an American
                non-stop flight. In November 1916, she flew from Chicago to
                Hornell, New York. The feat was a dangerous one. She had to
                modify her plane, by removing the lights and other parts, in
                order to carry extra fuel. &nbsp;While seated in her plane, Law
                was exposed to the elements on three sides, requiring her to
                wear four woolen and leather suits for protection.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Law had initially tried to purchase a larger plane for the
                trip, but was denied by the manufacturer (and Blanche Stuart
                Scott’s flight instructor), Glenn Curtiss. He said a bigger
                plane was “too much for a girl to handle.” She subsequently
                proved him, and all other doubters, wrong.</span

                accomplishments and challenge misconceptions along the way. She
                became the first woman to carry official air mail to the
                Philippine Islands. She worked as a flight instructor, and
                organized a barnstorming group called the “Ruth Law Flying
                Circus.” On another flight, she flew around the Statue of
                Liberty, spelling “Liberty” in the air with her plane.</span

                was the fourth woman to obtain a pilot’s license in the United
                States. She became the first commissioned woman to be a mail
                pilot and carried mail for the US Postal Service. Stinson was
                also a stunt pilot. Among her many great achievements, she was
                the first pilot to perform night skywriting and she taught
                herself the “loop-the-loop” stunt, flying in a vertical circle
                that sometimes turned the plane upside down. In addition to
                building her own plane, in 1917 she set a long distance record
                by flying 610 miles from San Diego to San Francisco.</span

                twice she volunteered as an ambulance driver. During her time
                serving in the military in Europe, she contracted tuberculosis.
                Due to her weakened health, Stinson was unable to fly again.
                After the war, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she had
                a second career as an architect until her death in 1977.</span

                faced financial hardship and racial discrimination. She later
                moved to Chicago where she became a manicurist. But after her
                brother John returned from World War I and teased her with
                stories of French women pilots, Coleman decided that she too
                would learn to fly.</span

              <span
                >Coleman was rejected from every US flight school she applied to
                because she was a woman and African American. With her savings
                and the support of generous African American businessmen
                (including millionaire Robert Abbott, the owner of </span
              ><em>The Chicago Defender</em
              ><span
                >, a weekly paper for African American readers), Coleman
                journeyed to France for flight school. She obtained her license
                from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale in June 1921,
                becoming the first African American woman to do so.</span

                entertaining crowds of thousands while refusing to participate
                in shows with segregated admission. She also gave flight lessons
                and lectures, encouraging other African American women to
                fly.</span

                locations for parachute jumps, her mechanic lost control and
                crashed. Bessie Coleman was thrown from the plane to her
                death.</span

                  After her death, air clubs for African Americans sprang up,
                  named in her honor. The first African American woman in space,
                  Mae Jemison, carried a picture of Bessie Coleman with her on

                since 1919, women were not allowed to compete &nbsp;until 1929.
                Though its official title was the Women’s Air Derby, it was
                nicknamed the “Powder Puff Derby” by humorist Will Rogers when
                he saw the pilots touching-up their makeup before climbing into
                the cockpit. The race ran from Santa Monica, California, to
                Cleveland, Ohio, and boasted a $25,000 prize.</span

                >It was dangerous going. Sandstorms or fog plagued visibility at
                several points. Emergency landings to make repairs were common
                and one pilot had to land to put out a fire in her plane with
                sand. There was one fatality in the race—Marvel Crosson, who
                crashed in the Gila Valley. Officials suspected she’d been
                poisoned with carbon monoxide by her malfunctioning
                aircraft.</span

                the winner in Cleveland. She flew the race with her face pressed
                up to an oxygen pipe to avoid the same carbon monoxide poisoning
                that had taken Crosson.</span

                >Since her rise to fame, Amelia Earhart has become the most
                well-known representative of early American women in flight.
                Though she’d been a pilot since 1921, she caught the world’s
                attention when she became the first woman to cross the Atlantic
                Ocean in a plane in 1928 (as a passenger, not a pilot). She
                decided to parlay her newfound icon status into advocating for
                aviation and for a place for women in the cockpit.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >Earhart was one of the founding members of the Ninety-Nines, an
                organization of women pilots founded in 1929 and named after its
                first member count. Most early female aviation milestones were
                attained by members of the Ninety-Nines and the organization
                continues today. Earhart herself served as president in
                1931.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >In addition to her advocacy work, Earhart made daring flights
                and captured the world’s attention. She was the first woman and
                second person to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. That same
                year she also became the first woman to fly solo across the
                North American continent.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Her most ambitious record attempt, to fly around the world, was
                also her last. She and her navigator, Fred Noonan, vanished over
                the Pacific Ocean, en route to Howland Island, in 1937. The
                mystery surrounding her disappearance continues to this day, as
                does her legacy of courage and advocacy for women’s
                equality.</span

                “written up” (marked as damaged) by instructors and students

                  women flew tracking and searchlight missions, towed gliders
                  and targets, flew radio-controlled target planes, and
                  delivered weapons, cargo, and personnel. In total, WASPs,
                  representing 78 bases across the nation, delivered 12,650
                  aircraft. Many more tested rocket-propelled planes, piloted
                  jet-propelled planes, and worked with radar-controlled targets
                  before the program was disbanded in December 1944.
                  Thirty-eight of these women died during their service: 11 in
                  training and 27 during missions.

                decision to deactivate the WASP program soon followed on October
                3, 1944. This decision was made by the War Department, based on
                signals that by the end of the year there would be enough male
                pilots for domestic assignments. The WASPs were no longer

                valuable I believe the whole WASP program has been for the
                country…we know that you are capable of ferrying, target towing,
                and test flying. So, on this last graduation day, I salute you
