            The Great Depression had an enormous impact on theatre across the
            United States. Productions decreased dramatically, audiences shrank,
            and talented writers, performers, and directors fled the industry to
            find work in Hollywood. But despite adversity, the show went on. The
            public construction projects of the Works Progress Administration
            built new theaters in cities across America. The Federal Theatre
            Project was established to fund theatre and performances across the
            country providing work to unemployed artists. This influx of new
            artists had transformed the industry, opening theatre to new voices,
            themes, and audiences. This exhibition explores these Depression-era
            changes and their impact on American theater.

                >In the aftermath of World War I, a new generation of savvy and
                creative theatrical talent emerged. Newly invigorated performing
                arts costume and set designers worked within the material and
                financial limitations of New York's regenerating theatre
                industry and depressed economy. The heavy-handed decorative
                design and hyperrealism of pre-war theatre began to fade as the
                high costs of supplies and labor forced this new cohort of young
                designers to develop a more economic design aesthetic. They
                became more interested in creating true-to-story artistic
                fantasies in which costumes and sets worked together and did not
                impede the progression of the production. English director and
                designer, Edward Gordon Craig, was a leader in the early
                twentieth-century movement against stark realism in theatre
                design. His ideas, which rose to popularity in the 1920s,
                emphasized artistic fantasy and originality while promoting
                production design that would reflect and convey a story.</span

                  >In the period leading up to the stock market crash of October
                  1929, theatre was the most popular form of U.S. entertainment.
                  In 1927 alone, Broadway debuted 250 shows and estimates place
                  audience attendance in New York City at 20 million people at a
                  time when New York’s resident and visiting populations were a
                  fraction of what they are today. By the late 1920s and early
                  1930s, new theatre establishments provided great opportunity
                  for vaudeville and musicals to emerge, as innovative
                  boundary-crossing works were produced for stages across the
                  country. &nbsp;</span

                >The Federal Theatre Project was founded in 1935 under the aegis
                of the Works Progress Administration. Established as part of
                President Roosevelt’s New Deal, it aimed primarily to provide
                relief to out-of-work actors and theater professionals by
                funding of theatre performances across the country and
                secondarily to bring relevant art in form of theatre to all
                Americans, particularly those who were suffering economically
                during the Depression. At its peak, it employed over 12,000
                workers nationwide. Under the leadership of Vassar College
                theater professor Hallie Flanagan, the Federal Theatre Project
                aimed to establish itself as a national theater program.
                Breaking with the past, it adopted a new, innovative, and
                inclusive approach to theater production--or as Flanagan put it,
                “re-thinking rather than remembering.” The goal was to create
                quality, entertaining productions but Flanagan, in particular,
                also emphasized theater’s value in educating and engaging
                audiences in social issues.</span

                  >It was this willingness—and in many cases eagerness—to engage
                  with social issues that ultimately planted the seeds of the
                  project’s demise. Since its inception, it had operated under
                  increasingly severe financial limitations, as well as
                  hostility from certain members of Congress and sections of the
                  press opposed to Roosevelt’s New Deal. Although it survived
                  drastic budget cuts in 1937, its treatment of social issues
                  served to intensify the opposition through the gaze of the
                  House of Un-American Activities Committee. The project had
                  become a political issue and, as support waned, a 1939
                  Congressional hearing cut funding completely—a final curtain
                  call for the project after four years.</span

                Theatre Project in 1935. It established units located in
                different cities and regions throughout the country. These unit
                sites included Seattle, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston,
                Hartford, Philadelphia, Newark, Raleigh, Durham, Birmingham,
                Chicago, Peoria, and Cleveland. The project provided much-needed
                job opportunities to African American theatre professionals and
                facilitated many contributions to African American arts and
                cultural history.</span

              Of the Negro Theatre Project units, the New York unit, located in
              the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, was perhaps the most active and
              well known. A number of Harlem Renaissance writers, like Countee
              Cullen, and Arna Bontemps, found funding and new audiences for
              their productions through the program. White playwrights depicting
              African American life also staged productions through the New York
              unit with casts of black actors and black production teams.

                >The Federal Theatre Project ended in 1939 when Congress
                suspended its federal aid funding. Because of the varying
                quality of productions, audience attendance at shows diminished,
                which in turn prompted low-ticket sales and the early
                cancellation of shows. Since majority of the FTP plays were
                based on economic and social justice themes, there were
                speculations about the plays being influenced by Communist
                ideologies.</span

              <span
                >The Federal Theatre Project was an arts and cultural movement,
                which served as both a professional and cultural platform that
                created many career opportunities to up and coming actors,
                directors, costumes designers, technicians among other theater
                and arts professionals during the Great Depression.
                &nbsp;Although the project was formally cancelled, it had a
                broad impact on the careers of many of these professionals and
                shed light on the educational and community purposes to which
                theatre could be put. &nbsp;While the Federal Theatre Project
                created a Depression-era platform for established playwrights
                like Eugene O’Neill, it also provided a starting point for the
                careers of new ones like Arthur Miller. Its programs paved the
                way for predecessor organizations like the American Negro
                Theatre, which grew out of the disbanded Negro Theatre Project.
                This group would train a new generation of actors like Harry
                Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, and Ruby Dee, who would become
                fixtures on American stage and screen in later decades and would
                be known particularly for their investment in exploring race and
                inequality. The tensions between FTP theatre professionals and
                Congress around social issues in art foreshadowed the intrusions
                of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities
                Committee hearings into the lives and works of playwrights and
                other artists in the 1950s. As its impact demonstrates, the
                Federal Theatre Project was a powerful and influential movement
                that altered the landscape of post-Depression-era American
                theater through its innovative productions and ideas about how
                theatre can engage national and local audiences.</span

                sought to regulate morality in society as a whole, as well as in

                entertainers on New York’s Broadway stages performing for a
                variety of audiences. Shows began to emerge that presented black
                life in a more realistic, sympathetic manner where previously
                black roles were performed by white actors in blackface and
                black performers were only seen in revues and vaudeville. A
                significant moment in theatre of this period was the opening of

                the main characters, including Brutus Jones played by black
                actor Charles Gilpin. For his work in this role, the Drama
                League of New York recognized Gilpin as one of the ten people in
                1920 that had done the most for American theater.</span

              The first “talking film” to premiere was Al Jolson’s “The Jazz
              Singer” in October 1927. For the first time American audiences
              were able to see and hear musical entertainment in new
              environments without having to attend live performances in select
              theaters. Only two years earlier in 1925, nearly 1,500 vaudeville
              theatres operated entertaining millions of Americans. But as
              American film culture became more and more central in American
              entertainment, only 300 traditional theaters were left, with the
              majority of others offering a split bill sharing performance space
              with films. Many actors left the stage and headed west to
              California to make it in the blossoming film industry, and the
              first true film stars emerged by the late 1920s.

                Theatre Project established regional administrations throughout
                the country. These regional centers adapted themselves to the
                needs of their local communities addressing issues of both
                national and local significance. Within each region, production
                was divided between different units, each one tackling different
                themes and genres. Vital to the success of this decentralized
                organization was the work of the National Service Bureau. It
                helped coordinate efforts across the country by writing and
                translating plays, sharing research and resources and providing
                a crucial support structure, especially to smaller
                projects.</span

              ><em>It Can’t Happen Here</em
              ><span
                >, went even further, opening with twenty-two simultaneous
                productions, each one catering to a particular local community.
                Alongside these exchanges between regional hubs, traveling
                caravan theaters brought performances to remote areas, which
                would not otherwise have opportunity to see live performances.
                By the late 1930s the Federal Theatre Project had established
                itself as a national theater both of and for the people.</span

                review from 1938 describes this modern, controversial drama as
                displaying an “evangelistic fury” bathed in “good old basic
                melodrama that keeps the audience both interested and aroused.”
                As the review anticipated, the play stoked controversy but
                demonstrated that productions navigating between heavy socially
                committed activism and melodramatic entertainment could appeal
                to a wide audience.</span

                >The Federal Theatre Project was committed to children’s theater
                from the beginning, establishing a children’s unit in every
                major city across the country. The result was a wide range of
                productions with an emphasis on both education and
                entertainment. In order to reinforce this educational dimension,
                the administration provided local schools with materials to
                encourage teachers to discuss and perform plays in the
                classroom.</span

            </p>
            <p>
              Faced with limited budgets, these children’s units favored puppet
              shows as a low-cost, efficient way to bring performances to remote
              communities. In any given week during this period, around one
              hundred marionette performances could be seen in schools,
              hospitals, theaters and parks across the country. On top of this,
              dozens of workshops were set up that allowed children to learn how
              to build and perform their own marionette performances.

                  example was the 1937 production of </span

                  in New York. Focusing on a community of downtrodden beavers,
                  the story follows their attempts to organize a union and
                  overthrow their wealthy oppressor. Described by </span

                  drama critic Brooks Atkinson as “[Mother Goose] studying

                most popular theatre performance of the Negro Theatre Project’s
                New York unit. The play was performed at Lafayette Theater in
                Harlem, New York in 1936. While the original </span
              ><em>Macbeth</em
              ><span>
                took place in Scotland, Welles set his version in the Caribbean
                island of Haiti in the court of King Henri Christophe—a former
                slaver and leader in the Haitian Revolution. &nbsp;</span

              <span
                >Welles brought magical realism and aspects of Haitian culture
                to the production. The play included drummers who played and
                sang chants from voodoo ceremonies. &nbsp;Welles reimagined the
                witches from the original Macbeth as voodoo priestesses.
                Costumes reflected fashion from Haiti’s nineteenth-century
                colonial period. Welles also created set design looked like a
                Caribbean jungle. &nbsp;He recreated this theme by instructing
                his set-design team to paint large and green tropical leaves in
                the theater’s backdrop.</span

                  Welles captivated audiences by making his own version of </span
                ><span>Macbeth</span
                ><span>
                  filled with dynamic performances and exuberant imagery on
                  stage. &nbsp;But plenty of controversy surrounded this play
                  during its run at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem. Some
                  critics felt that Welles, by casting an entire company of
                  African-American actors, strove to mock them through comedy
                  because they were acting and speaking in the “Shakespearian
                  way.” &nbsp;Other critics felt that Welles’ casting of African
                  American actors allowed these actors to show their talent and
                  tenacity during performances in front of segregated audiences.
                  In part because of its African American actors and Caucasian
                  director in Welles, </span
                ><em>Voodoo Macbeth</em
                ><span>
                  highlighted tensions within its audiences. Like many of the
                  Federal Theatre Project productions, it raised contemporary
                  social issues that for some drew uncomfortable attention to
                  national problems.
