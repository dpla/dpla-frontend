              >In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana
              Territory—800,000 square miles of land in the interior of North
              America. Most of this land had not been previously explored or
              documented. President Thomas Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis and
              William Clark to lead an ambitious military expedition, seeking a
              northwestern passage to the Pacific Ocean and to document their
              journey in this unknown territory. Starting in what is now
              Missouri, the expedition followed the Missouri River and passed
              through present-day Montana on its way to the Pacific. The
              explorers commented on the beauty of the landscape and the
              abundance of animals, and their descriptions attracted fur traders
              and others ready to take advantage of the region's abundant
              natural resources. The discovery of gold in 1862 brought in the
              first rush of people and subsequent mining forever changed the
              region. The mining industry demanded support in the form of towns,
              railroads, logging, ranching, and farming. These industries shaped
              Montana and the people who settled there.</span

            <h2>Fur Trading</h2>
            <p>
              <span
                >At the beginning of the nineteenth century, many American
                Indian tribes inhabited present-day Montana, trading with
                Europeans and other tribes, travelling seasonally, and competing
                with one another for wealth and power. These included the
                Kootenai, Salish, Pend d’Oreille, Shoshone, Crow, Piegan
                Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Cree and Chippewa, Sioux,
                and Northern Cheyenne.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >The area's first white settlers were fur traders from Canada,
                England, and the United States who explored the region looking
                for beaver for fur companies like the Hudson Bay Company and the
                American Fur Company. These fur traders arrived in the first
                half of the nineteenth century following the trail used by Lewis
                and Clark.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >Fur traders venturing into native lands faced risks that were
                easier to negotiate if the trapper took a native wife. Native
                women played a significant role in teaching their non-Indian
                husbands how to navigate the territory, where to find food, how
                to survive the winters, how to communicate with Indians, and how
                to peacefully negotiate places to trap. The offspring of these
                interracial marriages created a new group called the
                Metis.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                ><span
                  >Fur companies became bitter rivals and competition often
                  turned violent. The non-Indians pressured Indians to take
                  sides. This led to further violence and eventually revenge
                  killings. The fur trade brought goods to the Indians that they
                  quickly became dependent on, adding to pressures they faced to
                  maintain the relationships with the fur traders. Realizing the
                  power of cheap whiskey, fur traders often used this item to
                  exercise control over the Indians. Along with the important
                  trade items came disease. Smallpox and other deadly diseases
                  decimated the Indian populations.</span

                "The Old Mining Town of Kendall, Montana," ca. 1900. Kendall,
                located in central Montana's Judith Mountains, received a rush
                of gold miners in the 1890s. Courtesy of the Montana Historical

                >Mining played an important role in Montana's evolution from
                wilderness to an organized state. The first miners were
                high-risk fortune hunters who rushed into profitable areas and
                quickly abandoned unprofitable sites. These miners had small
                placer operations—mining methods that used water—which required
                simple equipment such as a gold pan, pick, shovel, and a water
                source. Other placer miners added items such as a rocker, which
                two people operate to sift the minerals from the rock. Both
                methods of placer mining required manual labor and water for
                washing the gravel and sand away from the heavier gold. Small
                miners often worked long, hard days for a couple dollars worth
                of gold.</span

                  >Montana had three major strikes that produced large amounts
                  of gold. In July 1862, a prospector named John White and his
                  partner discovered gold at Grasshopper Creek and founded the
                  town of Bannack nearby. Grasshopper Creek produced five
                  million dollars in gold dust in its first year. In May 1863,
                  two prospectors left Bannack to search for gold, bringing them
                  into conflict with the Crow Indians who took the miners'
                  equipment and sent them packing. On their way back, the men
                  camped along Alder Creek and decided to pan a little. Their
                  panning produced gold and within a few months hordes had
                  flocked to the area around Virginia City.

                  and easy to remove. Over the next four years, Last Chance
                  Gulch produced nineteen million dollars in gold. Soon the city
                  of Helena grew up around the gulch.</span

                >The start of the gold rush in 1862 ushered in a much greater
                demand for lumber than Montana forests had previously seen.
                Lumber was required for the new industry and the influx of
                people who rushed to the territory seeking their fortunes.
                Miners needed everything from sluice boxes, to firewood, to
                cabins, to stores. Wagons, bridges, and other transportation
                infrastructure used in mining required wood. One of the first
                sawmills was established near Virginia City in 1862. Lack of
                access to proper tools forced many loggers to improvise tools
                for logging. Dozens of small steam or water-powered lumber mills
                were soon operating in communities throughout the region.</span

                  >Logging originally required lots of manual labor. Sawyers
                  would first cut a notch in one side of a tree to determine the
                  direction of its fall. Then the fellers, who used a two-man
                  crosscut saw, would fell the tree. Logs were taken by horse
                  drawn wagons to the nearest river for transport when the water
                  ran high. Locations near water were soon stripped of trees
                  forcing loggers to travel farther to timber sources. Some
                  companies built railroad tracks into heavily timbered areas.

                  100-ton winch, called steam donkeys, to haul logs to a road or
                  railroad. The 1920s brought gasoline-powered tractors, trucks,
                  and other vehicles. This industrialization made logging easier
                  but created new problems for the natural environment, such as
                  erosion and damage to animal habitats.</span

                >The early cattle industry in Montana began to supply fur
                trading posts and missions with meat. In the 1850s, fur traders
                like Richard Grant began buying exhausted cattle from wagon
                trains traveling the Oregon Trail. These cattle were moved to
                range ground and "fattened up" before being herded back to the
                Oregon trail to be traded or sold.</span

              <span
                >When gold was discovered in the late nineteenth century, the
                cattle industry boomed. As more and more gold miners and
                prospectors poured into Montana, more and more food was needed
                to feed them. These new hunters quickly depleted Montana's wild
                game populations and then turned to ranchers for their meat
                supply.</span

                  >With a new market for their cattle, ranchers liked Montana
                  for its abundant open land for grazing as well as its high
                  quality grass. The hardy Montana grasses dried standing up and
                  strong winter winds blew snow away so the grass did not
                  flatten, making it edible all winter. As hunters seeking furs
                  decimated the bison herds, open-range ranching grew. The wide
                  tracts of land claimed by the US Government in treaties and by
                  force from Indian tribes made prime grazing country that was
                  newly available to use.</span

                >During the boom years of 1909-1919, homesteaders filed claims
                on twenty-five million acres in Montana. Montana's climate was
                in a wet cycle from 1909 to 1917, which encouraged homesteaders
                to flock to Montana for the free land and set to work farming
                and developing farming methods. Money poured into the state to
                encourage the development of irrigation projects. Other farmers
                worked to develop dryland farming techniques. James J. Hill,
                owner of the Great Northern Railroad, sponsored dryland farming
                conferences and exhibitions.

              <span
                >Hardy Webster Campbell promoted subsurface compacting, a method
                of plowing that firmly packed the loose soil at the bottom of a
                furrow so it would hold water where the roots developed. Then
                the top two to three inches were tilled into a loose, dry layer.
                Researchers at Montana Agricultural College, now Montana State
                University, advocated against use of this method, but many
                farmers put it into practice. Homesteaders learned over time how
                detrimental their farming methods were to the land because their
                nutrient-rich topsoil blew away in Montana's heavy winds.</span

                  >When the United States entered World War I in 1917, farmers'
                  markets expanded once again. The government pushed farmers to
                  increase production to meet the demands of a nation at war
                  with slogans such as "Food will win the war." Farmers borrowed
                  money to buy land and equipment. When the war ended, many
                  farmers were deep in debt. The wet cycle of Montana's climate
                  ended bringing fires, drought, and locusts. Between 1921 and
                  1925 at least half of the farmers in Montana lost their farms.
                  Farmers who were successful in keeping and enlarging their
                  holdings improved farming practices through the use of better
                  methods and improved equipment.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >In the 1850s, treaties were drawn up to define the boundaries
                of land Indians were reserving for themselves, closely mirroring
                traditional hunting grounds and tribal territories. Due to
                language barriers and different styles of governing, confusion
                reigned. The treaties supposedly gave non-Indians permission to
                build roads and railroads through the reservations in exchange
                for annuities. Despite protections promised by the treaties,
                settlers were encouraged to trespass on Indian lands to log,
                farm, ranch, and mine. The government sometimes neglected to pay
                the agreed-upon annuities, and when they did, they paid with
                low-quality or broken equipment and spoiled food.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >The US government wanted to profit from Montana’s natural
                assets and gave executive orders to reduce the size of
                reservations and used military force to ensure compliance. The
                Indians did not believe in land ownership, and this caused
                problems as assimilation efforts pushed the Indians to settle in
                one place to farm or ranch. In order to free up more land for
                white development, Congress passed the Dawes Act in 1887, which
                divided tribal lands into allotments of 160 acres for each head
                of household and 80 acres for each single man. Any land left
                after these allotments were established was considered surplus
                and sold to white settlers. In Montana, 400,000 acres were
                surplused.</span

                  enough and felt Indian children needed to be raised like white
                  children to speed the process along. Indian children were
                  forcibly taken from their parents and sent to military-like
                  boarding schools to be educated and taught to work.</span

                >Montana's early white settlers developed a small network of
                forts used as trading posts. These sites were visited by hired
                fur traders, local Indian traders, early missionaries arriving
                to convert and assimilate American Indians, and others looking
                to acquire supplies and exchange news. One of the earliest
                examples was Fort Benton, built by the Chouteau brothers—Western
                Agents for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company—and
                positioned at a port on the Missouri River to facilitate trade
                by riverboat.</span

                  >After the American Civil War, the US Army purchased old forts
                  and constructed new ones to protect and support growing
                  numbers of white settlers moving into the Montana Territory.
                  These forts were stops along trails, like the Bozeman Trail,
                  used for early Gold Rush travel. As the US Army focused its
                  attention increasingly on the West and its containment of
                  American Indian tribes on reservations, these forts provided
                  supplies and housing for divisions of soldiers fighting in the
                  Indian Wars, including divisions made up of African Americans
                  known as Buffalo Soldiers.

                  of Little Bighorn in 1876, and despite the fact that many
                  Indians were already living on reservations, the US Army
                  created new outposts like Fort Custer, Fort Keogh, and Fort
                  Ellis to protect settlers from real and imagined Indian
                  threats. These forts also provided jumping-off points for
                  military exploration into surrounding unsettled areas like
                  present-day Yellowstone National Park. Many of the military
                  forts were decommissioned around the 1880s with the arrival of
                  the railroad, while others were absorbed into Indian
                  reservations.</span

                >Early settlers and industrialists realized that the Montana
                Territory would need to be connected to the rest of the nation
                in order to grow. Railroads would make remote places accessible
                to new residents, while shipping the area’s plentiful natural
                resources to markets across the country.</span

                >By 1869, the Union Pacific Railroad’s route through Corinne,
                Utah, would bring the Transcontinental Railroad within 500 miles
                of Montana. The Union Pacific started laying track for the Utah
                and Northern Railway that would connect its system with Butte’s
                mines. After eight years of arduous construction, the first
                train arrived in Butte, Montana, in 1881. This symbolic starting
                point still left most of Montana without railroad access.</span

                >As the planning began on massive railroad lines across the
                southern and northern parts of the territory, railroad companies
                realized that they would need control of more Indian lands. They
                pressured the government to negotiate reductions of Indian
                reservation land through new agreements. Through these corrupt
                dealings, in 1882, the Crow would lose 1.5 million acres to the
                Northern Pacific Railroad, while in 1887, northern tribes would
                sell 17 million acres of land—including the sacred Sweetgrass
                Hills region—to the Great Northern Railway for 1.5 millions
                dollars that was never paid in full.</span

                  with the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad,
                  which arrived in 1907, employed Asian immigrants in
                  low-paying, back-breaking jobs laying their track and African
                  Americans who worked as porters and waiters on the trains.
                  Their rail lines soon crisscrossed Montana, connecting towns,
                  facilitating industrial boom years, and marking the transition
                  to statehood.</span

                >The Homestead Act of 1862 enabled thousands to claim land in
                Montana. This act offered 160 acres of public land to US
                citizens on the condition that they live on, cultivate, and
                improve it. They could then "prove up" and obtain a deed after
                five years. The first homestead claim was made near present-day
                Helena in 1868.</span

              <span
                >However, the original Homestead Act did not attract large
                numbers of settlers to Montana due to the small size of land
                relative to the growing conditions and type of dry farming
                required. Congress passed several supplementary laws including
                the 1877 Desert Land Act, which allowed homesteaders to claim
                640 acres of land if they irrigated within three years. These
                claims appealed to cattle companies who acquired land earned
                through hired individual claimants. By 1882, 370 desert claim
                filings were made in the Montana Territory covering 122,000
                acres.</span

                  >But it was the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 that brought
                  the greatest influx of homesteaders to Montana. Most were
                  individual farmers. This new act doubled the amount of land
                  available for claim to 320 acres and later shortened the
                  "prove up" time to three years. Railroads launched massive
                  advertising campaigns to bring homesteaders to Montana. More
                  than 80,000 homesteaders arrived between 1909 and the early
                  1920s. At its peak in 1918, 14,178 homestead claims were filed
                  on 3.2 million acres. When it was over, an estimated 300,000
                  people had filed for homesteads in Montana with at least
                  eighteen percent of these claims filed by unmarried
                  women.</span

                >The tremendous flood of people attracted to Montana by the gold
                rush created an immediate need for law and order. The gold
                fields attracted all kinds of people including those who would
                profit from the hard work of others by becoming criminals.
                Miners courts were developed to handle many disputes, but were
                hardly equipped to deal with the amount of violence present in
                the mining camps. One of the most famous criminals in Montana
                was Henry Plummer, who was, ironically, sheriff of the Bannack
                District. He and his gang were suspected of robbing gold
                shipments and murdering miners for their gold. Plummer met his
                end swinging from a rope hung by the local vigilance
                committee.</span

                wanted some form of protection and acted as a police force for
                an area hundreds of miles away from any official law
                enforcement. Vigilante justice was swift and not always reliable
                as it often took little evidence for a conviction and hanging to
                occur.</span

                  present-day Montana, which at the time was part of the Idaho
                  territory, to become chief justice. Edgerton quickly
                  recognized the value of the gold being produced in the Bannack
                  area and the need for this region to have its own territorial
                  government. In 1864, Edgerton returned to Washington to
                  advocate for this idea. On May 26, 1864, Congress created the
                  Montana Territory with Lincoln appointing Edgerton as the
                  first territorial governor.</span

                >As the nation industrialized, the demand for natural resources
                fed the expansion of railroads. These railroads allowed the
                expansion of mining operations with new heavy equipment which
                had previously not been available in Montana. Miners knew more
                gold was available but finding it would require digging shafts
                and tunnels into the hillsides. Quartz mining used large,
                expensive equipment in order to retrieve the buried gold. Large
                corporations, such as the Anaconda Company owned by Marcus Daly,
                were the only ones with the resources to purchase the equipment
                needed to successfully mine ore from these deep veins. With new
                equipment to retrieve the ore came the ability to mine many
                different precious and base metals including gold, silver,
                copper, zinc, aluminum, iron, lead, tungsten, uranium, platinum,
                manganese, and cobalt. Butte’s copper deposits became world
                famous as did the Copper Kings, Marcus Daly and William Clark.
                These two men owned the largest copper mining interests in
                Montana and waged war for control of the resources and politics
                of the state.</span

                  >Along with these resources, companies started to develop
                  Montana’s mineral resources such as coal, petroleum, natural
                  gas, gypsum, and limestone. Gemstones such as sapphires and
                  garnets were also mined in Montana. With dependable, high
                  capacity haulage introduced by the railroads, and year-round
                  service, Montana's mines grew as did the industries that
                  supported them. Larger, more stable mines and secondary
                  industries created growing and stable communities across
                  Montana.&nbsp;<span
                    >The major stakeholders of these mines and companies were
                    investors from back East. Therefore the mining profits left
                    the state rather than remain in the Montana
                    economy.&nbsp;</span

                >Historically, Montana’s natural resources have formed the basis
                of its economy. Mining brought in secondary industries like
                smelters, cement plants, construction, utilities, heavy
                equipment, and transportation. Unfortunately, these industries
                damaged the environment. Many Anaconda Mining Company ventures,
                including the smelters in Black Eagle and Anaconda, along with
                the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area, were named Superfund (or
                abandoned hazardous waste) cleanup sites in the early 1980s by
                the Environmental Protection Agency. Libby was named a Superfund
                site because of asbestos mining, while East Helena earned the
                same designation because of the smelting conducted there by the
                American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). Environmental
                abuses, such as the Berkeley Pit, had a major impact on
                Montana's 1972 Constitution, which features very strong legal
                language granting its citizens the right to a clean and
                healthful environment.</span

                  >Montana's mining sector transformed its cultural and
                  political history. The Copper Kings’ money influenced state
                  politics heavily and even the location of the capital city.
                  Women, who were allowed to file mining claims and hold their
                  own property, helped Montana elect the first woman to
                  Congress, Jeannette Rankin, in 1916. Jobs drew people to
                  Montana who built and diversified its communities.</span

                Tin Cup Creek, 1914. Loggers required large meals and lots of
                coffee to perform their work. Courtesy of the Darby Community

                >Early Montana lumberjacks worked twelve to fourteen-hour days
                felling trees. They awoke before dawn, ate breakfast, then hiked
                to the woods to saw and swing axes in the heat or freezing cold.
                Injury from falling branches or a crushing death among floating
                logs during a river drive were job hazards to avoid before
                returning to camp for dinner at day's end. The men often slept
                two to a bed in crowded bunkhouses infested by bedbugs without
                the benefit of a shower, toilet, or laundry facilities. Logging
                was an exhausting, dangerous, and probably smelly affair.</span

              <span
                >Forester Elers Koch also described the lumberjack life as
                lonely. “One hears little of laughter and jokes in a logging
                camp. [The] men eat their enormous meals silently, and sit in
                the bunkhouse or outside them, tired from the heavy work that
                goes with the job of man-handling big logs.” The fact that many
                lumberjacks were immigrants who spoke little English may have
                contributed to this sense of isolation.</span

                  >These men sacrificed home comforts and family life for their
                  paychecks only to be taken advantage of by some lumber
                  companies. Until labor unions could organize it was typical
                  for company sanctioned employment “fees” to whittle away hard
                  earned wages to nearly nothing before the men were fired and
                  replaced by new crews. These unfair practices eventually
                  incited strikes and Montana lumber company owners had to
                  negotiate on pay, workday hours, and logging camp
                  conditions.</span

                seized the opportunity to exercise their political power in
                order to guarantee their access to the abundant natural
                resources across Montana. Railroads, mines, smelters, and towns
                all used enormous amounts of lumber. Railroads used vast amounts
                of timber for ties, to brace tunnels, and to support trestles
                and bridges. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company used more than
                200,000 board feet of timber every day in its mines. Smelters
                burned thousands of cords per day in their smelting
                processes.</span

                company became one of the most aggressive logging companies,
                cutting timber wherever they could, including illegally on
                public lands and on the Flathead Indian Reservation.

                  alone. Marcus Daly told Congress that 10,000 workers would
                  lose their jobs if the illegal logging stopped. The Northern
                  Pacific Railroad used its power to gain support of Montana’s
                  territorial governor, Samuel T. Hauser. They threatened to
                  remove all railroad money from Hauser’s bank if he did not
                  oppose the federal lawsuits. The lawsuits dragged on for years
                  while illegal logging practices continued in Montana. The
                  massive deforestation of many areas prompted many to call for
                  a better logging management system.</span

                >Alarm over aggressive logging practices and land use encouraged
                Congress to step in and pass the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.
                Fifteen forest reserves were formed as a result of this
                legislation. By 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an act
                that transferred the management of these protected lands to a
                bureau that eventually came to be known as the US Forest
                Service.</span

                conservation of timberland resources. Logging companies were
                required to seek permission and follow regulations in order to
                log within national forests. Many loggers, miners, and ranchers
                protested the new restrictions placed on western public lands by
                eastern politicians.</span

                  >A devastating series of forest fires swept over Washington,
                  Idaho, and Montana in the summer of 1910, culminating on
                  August 20 and 21 in what would later be called the "Big
                  Blowup." Only five years after the US Forest Service’s
                  founding, this event deeply influenced the early direction of
                  the agency. Forest Service chiefs and other leaders and
                  advocates for particular approaches to fire protection were
                  directly involved in the Big Blowup. It pushed forest fire
                  issues into the public discourse, and led to new fire
                  prevention and suppression policies that continue to influence
                  fire management around the world.</span

                >In the 1850s, one of the earliest large cattle herds in Montana
                was driven from Oregon for the Jesuit Priest, Father Desmet, to
                the Mission Valley in western Montana. Later, cattle drives from
                Texas brought a large number of stock to Montana following the
                Civil War. Texas herds had been left untended during the war and
                had grown beyond the land's grazing limits. Texas ranchers began
                trailing cattle northward to find new range lands. Many of these
                drives ended in Montana’s open grasslands. One cowboy, traveling
                north with a herd of 2,000 cattle, estimated there were 58,000
                cattle within eyesight on the trail.</span

                >During the 1880s, the United States and Europe experienced
                population booms, which created an even greater demand for beef.
                The completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1883 enabled
                Montana ranchers to ship their cattle to markets across the
                country.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >In the drier parts of the territory, one cow needed 250 acres
                of land a year to graze. Some cattle ranches had 10,000 cows,
                and a few had as many as 40,000. Ranchers required vast amounts
                of land and water to support this booming industry. It was
                estimated in the spring of 1885 there were 500,000 cattle in
                Montana, and overgrazing had become an issue.</span

                  >The winter of 1886–1887 was one of the most severe winters
                  remembered by the early ranchers. Heavy early snows were
                  followed by a warming trend, which was followed by another
                  severe drop in temperature. Grass was frozen solid under the
                  ice and already exhausted cattle could not paw into the ice to
                  eat. Some estimate that 362,000 cattle or sixty percent of
                  Montana's herds died of starvation that winter.</span

                >An influx of homesteaders led to fencing and farms, diminishing
                grazing land for cattle and marking the end of the open-range
                era. Natural disasters such as drought and overgrazing, as well
                as an extremely severe winter in 1886–1887, contributed to the
                decline of the cattle industry. By 1890, sheep were becoming the
                predominant stock shipped into Montana.</span

                >Sheep are historically the second most numerous type of
                livestock in Montana after cattle. In 1847, Father DeSmet
                brought sheep to the Bitterroot Valley in western Montana. The
                industry began to grow in 1869 with the arrival of a band of
                1,500 sheep from Oregon in the Beaverhead Valley in the western
                part of the territory. The first herd in eastern Montana was
                located in Miles City in 1876. The climate and land were
                well-suited for sheep, providing a good return on a modest
                investment.</span

                >After the decline of the cattle industry following the
                disastrous winter of 1886–1887, sheep were allowed to graze on
                land formerly filled with cattle. Acres of land covered with
                wild forage that could not support cattle turned out to be
                perfect for sheep. Sheep handled Montana winters well, cost less
                to raise than cattle, and brought in annual profits from their
                wool.</span

                source to build a ranch around. A rancher who claimed a 360 acre
                homestead with access to water could then use the open range to
                graze thousands of acres. Ranchers began dividing the Montana
                Territory into grazing districts, which were managed by ranchers
                who unofficially claimed a grazing area or "range." Range
                boundaries and brand descriptions would be published in the
                nearest local newspapers.</span

                tended to the cattle. The work of cowboying entailed hard
                physical labor and required an adventurous spirit. The
                profession attracted young men—many began as teenagers—who
                enjoyed working together. Few older men had the stamina to work
                in the bitter cold of winter and blazing heat of the summer
                months.</span

                  spent months at a time alone on the range. They travelled by
                  horse, but also put in many miles by foot to keep track of
                  their flocks and protect them from wild animals and
                  disease.</span

                  were ideal for cattle grazing, but this meant that neighbors
                  and cities were few and far between, making family central to
                  the success of the ranch. The frontier women maintained the
                  house, cooked, and often acted as doctors and accountants for
                  the ranch. The ranching women of Montana were an irreplaceable

                >Montana's plains, mountains, and climate divides the state into
                sections most suited to different crops. In the eastern and
                central plains of the state, homesteaders grew grains and sugar
                beets. Many homesteaders planted fields of flax their first year
                out because it was a crop well suited to the freshly tilled
                soil. Some farmers used sugar beets as a rotation crop to
                increase soil productivity. During the early wet years of
                homesteading, farmers made abundant yields on their grain crops
                such as wheat and flax. By 1915, crop production was at an all
                time high in Montana with wheat yielding as much as 25 bushels
                per acre. By 1920, returning dry weather patterns plunged wheat
                production to around 2.4 bushels per acre. Because of production
                issues, many homesteaders lost their farms and moved into towns
                or out of Montana altogether.</span

                  after for farm production. Producers found that a variety of
                  crops such as grain, hay, and fruit, including apples and
                  cherries, could be grown in this ideal climate and orchards
                  sprang up in many areas. Dry weather patterns impacted western

                >Homesteaders played a very important role in the development of
                Montana as a state. They helped build communities, towns, and
                schools and created cooperatives to provide services to
                communities in many areas. Homesteaders also supported women's
                suffrage, helping Montana become the tenth state to grant women
                the right to vote in 1914. Many women filed claims on homestead
                lands with some couples even getting divorced so the husband and
                wife could each claim their own land.</span

              <span
                >Homesteaders shaped Montana politics by helping elect Jeannette
                Rankin in 1916 as the first congresswoman in the nation and
                successfully campaigning for prohibition. Homesteaders worked
                hard to reduce railroad and mining company control of state
                politics. They helped split the large, sparsely populated
                counties into smaller ones so local government was more
                accessible to the people. Smaller counties required more county
                senators, which gave agricultural communities a stronger voice
                in state government.</span

                  positive. They played a large role in displacing Native
                  American people from their reservation lands. When farms did
                  not produce enough food, homesteaders dramatically depleted
                  wildlife numbers through overhunting. Farms also destroyed
                  valuable wildlife habitat further stressing herd
                  numbers.</span

                >Chinese people fleeing civil unrest in China came to America’s
                west coast looking for refuge and new opportunities. Many found
                work with the railroads. Chinese immigrants settled in Montana
                territory first as miners. Chinese settlements sprang up near
                mining towns, where Chinese worked abandoned mines searching for
                any remnants of gold. When the Chinese were successful at mining
                these played-out claims, they were often accused of stealing.
                Dan Haffie, an angry miner, committed the first recorded hanging
                in Butte when he claimed a Chinese man was getting all the luck
                and hung him from a nearby tree.</span

                  >The mining boom towns gave the Chinese an opportunity to open
                  businesses such as restaurants, pharmacies, boarding houses,
                  stores, and laundries. The largest Chinese population in
                  Montana was centered in the city of Butte. The labor unions
                  tried to force the Chinese out of town through a series of
                  business boycotts. The first boycott in 1891–1892 failed due
                  to popular support for Chinese businesses. A more organized
                  and aggressive boycott was launched by the labor unions in
                  1896. Hum Fay, Dr. Huie Pock, and Quon Loy filed suit against
                  the instigators and eventually won an injunction. They were
                  reimbursed their legal fees, but were not able to collect the
                  estimated $500,000 in damages incurred during the boycott from
                  1896 to 1901. During the boycott, hundreds of Chinese left
                  Butte. Some moved to other Montana communities, but many left
                  the state.</span

                >After the Civil War, free black men and women came west to seek
                their fortunes. The West offered new opportunities to seek
                gainful employment. Many of the earliest black settlers worked
                as miners, cowboys, cooks, and domestic help. The mining towns
                of Virginia City, Helena, and later Butte had the largest
                African American populations.</span

                >African American women were afforded opportunities in the
                Montana Territory that were not available to them in other
                places. In 1895, Mary Fields became the second woman and the
                first black woman to work for the US postal service when she was
                the fastest applicant to hitch a team of six horses. She earned
                the nickname "Stagecoach" because she was so reliable. In 1900,
                Sarah Bickford inherited her husband's assets including his
                two-thirds share of the Virginia City Water Company and became
                the first black woman to operate a utility company.</span

                  >The US Army employed African American soldiers in segregated
                  regiments. The 25th Infantry regiment was one of four United
                  States Colored Troops regiments in the country. Many companies
                  of the 25th regiment were stationed in Montana forts in the
                  1880s to assist in maintaining peace with the Indians. In
                  1896, Lieutenant James A. Moss requested permission to form a
                  bicycle troop staffed with members of the 25th regiment to
                  test the use of bicycles as a military vehicle. Despite some
                  successes and freedoms, the African American population in
                  Montana remained very small. Discrimination persisted and,
                  along with other non-whites, Montana African Americans were
                  excluded from businesses and prevented from voting, often
                  through violent means.</span

                >European immigrants made up the largest share of men and women
                who came to Montana seeking work and fortunes. Its non-Indian
                population grew from 20,595 people in 1870 to nearly 143,000
                people by 1890. The boom and bust nature of Montana industries
                kept people on the move. In the silver panic of 1893, Granite
                silver mine shut down and the nearby mining town of Granite had
                3,000 people leave in a single day. Three years later, with
                silver prices back up, the Granite mine complex was the biggest
                mine in the world. Today, Granite is a ghost town.</span

                social gatherings for employees and their families, helped their
                members when they were sick, and paid for funeral expenses if a
                man was killed on the job.</span

                  >The Anaconda Copper Company, called “the company” by the
                  employees, was a huge political power. The company owned the
                  mines, smelters, and many of the state newspapers, and bribed
                  politicians. Men under the control of the company were said to
                  wear the “copper collar.” In 1903, the company shut down,
                  forcing thousands of employees out of work until the
                  legislature passed the legislation it sought. The company also
                  paid men to join the unions and to seek positions of
                  leadership, so eventually they controlled the unions too.
                  Meaderville, McQueen, and East Butte, once thriving Butte
                  neighborhoods, were destroyed so the company could create
                  Berkeley pit.</span
