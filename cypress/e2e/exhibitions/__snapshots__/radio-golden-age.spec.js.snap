            <h4>
              <strong>The “Father of Radio” and the radio’s first voice</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The scientific background that would make radio possible dates
              back to the early 1800s, when things like electromagnetic waves
              and magnetic fields were just being discovered. In 1837, Samuel
              Morse patented his electric telegraph, which showed that it was
              possible for a telegraphic signal to travel long distances over a
              wire. By 1864, a physics professor at Cambridge University
              (England), James Clerk Maxwell, began thinking about
              electromagnetic waves and distance. He believed that waves could
              travel fast over long distances and his work set the stage for
              wireless transmission.&nbsp;Tests were conducted for the next
              several decades, challenging Maxwell’s theories about distance and
              speed.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
                It wasn’t until 1899 that the public got to see this scientific
                theory in action, when Italian scientist Guglielmo Marconi began
                using the telegraph to wirelessly announce the results of the
                America’s Cup races, from a ship at sea, back to New York.
                Though the technology that made this telegraph possible was the
                result of many scientists’ contributions, Marconi won the Nobel
                Prize for his work in 1909, and remains known as the “Father of
                Radio.” While Marconi’s wireless feat certainly made a splash,
                and helped Marconi establish his own broadcast company in 1901,
                radios were still used mostly by engineers and hobbyists.
                Wireless broadcasts didn’t yet convey sound—they were nothing
                more than coded dots and dashes, interpreted on the other end to
                convey a message.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="normal">
              All of that changed in 1906, when the first human voice and music
              recording was sent by Canadian physicist Reginald Fessenden from a
              station in Massachusetts and heard by listeners as far away as
              Virginia. The voice and music? Fessenden himself, singing and
              playing the violin. The radio as we know it had begun to take
              shape.&nbsp;

            <h4><strong>Radio during WWI&nbsp;</strong></h4>
            <p>
              At the onset of World War I, radio was still in its infancy. Army
              equipment was primitive, had a very short range, and often
              negotiated atmospheric interference. A 1913 aircraft with a radio,
              at the time considered cutting-edge equipment, had a maximum range
              of 2,000 yards. Military radio equipment also used vacuum tubes,
              which were heavy and bulky.&nbsp;As a result, the equipment was
              difficult to tote around on the battlefield, even on mules and
              horses, which were still the military’s primary mode of equipment
              transportation. The American army made some adaptations with the
              development of a "horse-pack set," which used a hand generator and
              was strapped to the side of a horse. The entire radio transmitter
              and receiver, in size and design, resembled a saddle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, this did not solve all of radio’s challenges. During the
              First World War, radio transmissions were often less reliable than
              using wired telephones or telegraphs. Radio really found a
              foothold, however, at sea, even before the United States’ direct
              involvement in World War I. President Wilson’s 1914 Executive
              Order allowed the Navy to censor international telegrams sent or
              received via radio. Though many, including the Marconi Wireless
              Company of America, vehemently challenged the censorship ban, it
              stuck, and so began the Navy’s heavy involvement with wartime
              radio. Navy radio stations, which had higher powered signals than
              those sent out on the frontlines, were able to relay timely
              wartime news to vessels at sea. There was some experimentation
              with troop entertainment via radio transmission, too, with
              broadcasts aimed at Navy ships at sea and wounded sailors
              recovering in hospitals. It is telling that the U.S. Navy press
              sent its final dispatch of the war, announcing armistice on
              November 11, 1918, via radio transmission.

              <strong>KDKA Pittsburgh: The first news program</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The 1920 presidential election was notable for a number of
              reasons. A landslide victory of Republican nominee Warren G.
              Harding was due in no small part to the first national election to
              include women voters, who had recently won the right to suffrage
              through the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment earlier that
              year. Election Day, November 2, 1920, also marked the beginning of
              news radio as we know it today.
            </p>
            <p>
              The radio station KDKA, which broadcasted from the rooftop of a
              Westinghouse Electric building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became
              the first licensed commercial radio station to produce a news
              program. Their launch was timed to allow listeners to learn the
              results of the election closer to real time, without having to
              wait to read about it in the newspaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              After being issued the first-ever radio license by the US
              Department of Commerce on October 27, 1920, the station chose the
              KDKA handle—the next set of call letters available on the roster
              of station identifiers, which were then used for ships and marine
              stations. After teaming up with the&nbsp;<em>Pittsburgh Post </em
              >newspaper to get the election results via telephone, their
              election-night coverage began at 6 pm. With four men on staff,
              they broadcasted the election results to approximately 1,000 of
              the nation's first news radio listeners.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The historic newscast was a hit and ultimately changed the way
              people received information. It instilled a greater sense of
              immediacy to the news, as radio shared stories with the public as
              they unfolded. It helped alter print media, too; instead of
              writers focusing on simply capturing the headline stories,
              journalists now had more room to delve into deeper and more
              complex features. Over the next several decades, scheduled news
              broadcasts became regular radio features on burgeoning networks,
              many of which, including ABC, NBC and CBS, still exist today.

            <h4><strong>Connecting the country</strong></h4>
            <p>
              Radio signaled a major shift in how Americans communicated. Once
              radios became widespread and affordable, they connected people in
              ways never before possible. By the 1920s, a few decades after
              Marconi’s first broadcast, half of urban families owned a radio.
              More than six million stations had been built. The numbers
              increased rapidly—by 1940, families were listening to their radios
              for more than four hours each day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Radio quickly became a way for American families to stay connected
              and receive news. This was particularly useful for Americans
              living in rural areas, which, during the radio's Golden Age, was
              about half of the country’s population. Before the radio, these
              isolated towns and families were slow to get the latest news or
              entertainment. Now, thanks to the radio, they were part of the
              larger American news and pop-culture phenomena. Particularly after
              the FCC changed its policy on the number of and space between
              radio stations after World War II, construction of new broadcast
              outlets in rural areas meant small towns were getting their own
              local stations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to getting the latest news, in close-to-real time,
              there quickly became a market for programming geared toward rural
              families. Though widespread radio features like market reports and
              weather forecasts had immense importance to farming populations,
              broadcasters quickly incorporated more agriculturally focused
              programs. Some were local, like farming lectures broadcast from
              land grant colleges. Others had a broader audience, like NBC's
              "National Farm and Home Hour." Even the music aimed at this
              audience was different—networks began incorporating more folk and
              “barn dance” programs into their lineups, a break from more
              urban-focused pop acts.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              While radio equipment and programming provided for a growing
              American market, there were still barriers for many. Especially
              during the Great Depression, purchasing a radio was a big
              investment. While the radio itself might have brought news and pop
              culture to rural Americans, those who couldn’t afford the price
              tag of a new set remained unconnected.

            <h4><strong>TV: A member of the family&nbsp;</strong></h4>
            <p class="normal">
              The 1950s signaled a change in the Golden Age of radio, with the
              development and quick popularity of the home television set. The
              television had been in development since the late 1920s,
              throughout the rise and dominance of radio. RCA, one of the
              biggest companies behind the popularization of the radio, poured
              millions of dollars into developing the television. By 1939, RCA
              was televising the New York World’s Fair, speeches by President
              Roosevelt (FDR becoming the first president to appear on a
              television screen), and baseball games. Still, the technology was
              primitive. Segments were only about 15 minutes long and used just
              a single camera to film.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              World War II, with its freeze on commercial television and general
              technology shortages, delayed the rise of the medium. Before 1947,
              only a few thousand American homes owned television sets. Just
              five years later, that number jumped to 12 million. By 1955, half
              of American homes had a TV set.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              A study conducted by CBS and Rutgers University during that time,
              which interviewed families with television sets, found that
              Americans enjoyed the new experiences television brought them.
              Families said they felt unified around their new TVs, that it
              helped parents and children socialize and connect in new ways and
              helped the family spend more time together. Some described their
              new TV sets as members of the family. Almost as quickly, the
              question was raised whether the time that families—particularly
              children—spent in front of the TV was really such a good thing.

              Once Fessenden’s initial broadcasts proved that sound could be
              transmitted via radio, technology advanced quickly—as did demand.
              The initial voice transmissions were often erratic and weak, and
              Fessenden couldn’t find buyers for his new technology. Spurred by
              the sinking of the&nbsp;<em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;in 1912, he moved on
              to a more lucrative business in inventing iceberg-detecting
              technology. Other scientists were fast to pick up where he left
              off, however.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1907, scientists had successfully amplified radio signals. FM
              (frequency modulation) broadcasts came along more than a decade
              later, providing a clearer signal than AM (amplitude modulation)
              stations (though RCA, then in the early stages of developing the
              television set, kept FM technology to the back burner until the
              1940s).
            </p>
            <p>
              With clearer signals that spanned longer distances came a demand
              from the public for new radio programming. The first entertainment
              broadcasts appeared in the 1910s, coinciding with the development
              and commercialization of the phonograph. Now, people could hear
              music on the radio and then buy recordings of it for their at-home
              phonographs, as they would do with their record players in the
              1950s. Formal newscasts began a decade later. By the 1920s,
              America entered what came to be known as the "Golden Age of
              Radio," which spanned until the 1950s and the advent of the
              at-home TV set. It was a time when many television genres we enjoy
              today found their start as radio staples: soap operas, game shows,
              variety acts, and mysteries. Millions of Americans tuned in.

            <p>
              After three decades of commercial dominance, a new cultural
              phenomenon was poised to take radio’s place as the centerpiece of
              1950s-America’s living rooms—the television set. Still, radio was
              a dominant force for entertainment and information sharing. The
              rise of the TV changed the way radio broadcasters shaped their
              content, and, ultimately, what Americans wanted to hear when they
              tuned in.
            </p>
            <p>
              The invention of the commercial transistor radio in 1954 made
              radio accessible and portable in a way never possible
              before.&nbsp;The first transistor radio, the Regency TR-1 model,
              was half a pound and could fit into your pocket. It was powered by
              a nine-volt battery—a now-standard kind of battery that was
              originally developed specifically for the transistor radio. Now,
              listeners didn’t have to sit in their living rooms to hear their
              favorite music or news program. These new portable radios also
              created the expectation for easy access to news and entertainment
              while on the go. Soon, radios were being installed in automobiles
              for wireless audio on the road.
            </p>
            <p>
              Radio broadcasts began to localize and increasingly concentrated
              on music programming over other entertainment programs, like
              dramas or comedies, which were popular throughout the early-to-mid
              twentieth century. Radio was cost-effective and drew in listeners.
              Between records, stations aired blocks of commercials, as well as
              live commentary. The radio networks enjoyed the advertising
              revenue, while the disc jockeys became popular radio
              personalities. (A 1954 case alleged that DJs were getting more
              than just notoriety—they were getting paid off by record companies
              to promote certain albums.) By the end of the 1950s, "Top 40"
              radio had debuted, and the now-big-name acts in rock-and-roll and
              pop were finding their first audiences on the airwaves. By the
              mid-1970s, there were still more than 4,000 AM stations and 3,500
              FM stations broadcasting across the United States. Though the
              television had changed the landscape, radio had evolved with it.

            <p>
              By the time the United States entered World War II in late 1941,
              radio technology had vastly improved from the equipment available
              in the 1910s. Vacuum tube radios, which just thirty years ago were
              bulky and hard to carry, were now smaller. This paved the way for
              lighter weight, portable, battery-operated transistor radios,
              encased in metal, for military field use during World War II. In
              addition to hand-held use by US soldiers on the ground, radios
              were now an integral part of airplane, submarine, and tank
              communications. Transmissions went greater distances and were more
              reliable, and soon became a staple of the war effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to make radio transmissions more secure, the US Marines
              employed Navajo, one of the most complex Native American
              languages, to send messages during World War II. The pilot project
              began with just 30 Navajo “code talkers,” who soon helped develop
              a virtually uncrackable cipher based in their native language
              (including "Moustache Smeller" as a code name for Adolf Hitler).
            </p>
            <p>
              The program was such a success, particularly against the Japanese,
              that the Navajo code talkers program grew to 420 men. Navajo code
              talkers became part of every US Marine assault in the Pacific
              theater and served in all Marine divisions. Though the Japanese
              eventually cracked the codes of the US Army and Air Corps, the
              Marine's Navajo code was never broken.&nbsp;

            <p>
              As radio made its impact on the World War II battlefields, it
              became essential for Americans tuning in at home. For the first
              time, families listening in heard wartime news in real time. On
              September 3, 1939, radio listeners heard Britain and France
              declare war on Germany and speeches by the UK Prime Minister and
              U.S. President Roosevelt as they happened. When the United States
              officially entered the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl
              Harbor in December 1941, listeners got an even fuller picture of
              what life was like on the battlefront. Most notably, award-winning
              journalist Edward R. Murrow became part of CBS News' efforts to
              bring the realities of the war back home through on-the-ground
              radio reporting. Murrow became famous for reporting live from
              London during the nine-month Nazi bombing campaign called the
              "Blitz."

            <p>
              Radio addresses from the front were coupled with broadcasts from
              leaders of the warring nations. Roosevelt’s fireside chats, which
              began in 1933 and lasted until 1944, became an intimate way for
              the president to directly communicate with radio listeners across
              the United States. During the war, the president was able to speak
              about the declaration of war and its progress, the US economy, and
              the movement toward peace. The concept and format allowed
              listeners to feel like the president was in their homes talking to
              them, letting them know they were going to make it through some of
              the nation’s toughest times.

              The war also influenced radio entertainment broadcasts, becoming a
              topic in radio serials and soap operas, often with racially
              charged caricatures of the Axis powers playing the villains.
              Government-sponsored broadcasts featured Hollywood celebrities
              sharing the virtues of collecting scrap metal and planting Victory
              gardens. Children’s programming was no exception. Boys and girls
              listening to the popular&nbsp;<em>Dick Tracy</em>&nbsp;series were
              urged to fight the enemy by pledging to save water, gas and
              electricity, and to "save my playthings" as well as "Mom's
              furniture."

            <p>
              The first regularly scheduled newscast began in 1926 on the
              National Broadcasting Company (NBC).The network was formed by
              General Electric, Westinghouse Electric, and the Radio Corporation
              of America (RCA). Though NBC originally began as a scheme to sell
              more RCA radios, it soon became a profitable entity in and of
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              NBC was the first permanent radio network, broadcasting primarily
              on the East Coast. It began with two networks: "red," which
              focused on entertainment and music, and "blue," which only carried
              news. This breakdown was duplicated on the West Coast a year
              later, in "orange" and "gold" with largely the same program
              lineup. The now universally identifiable NBC chime later debuted
              in 1929 as a way to fulfill a requirement by NBC's broadcast
              license to present its station identification.
            </p>
            <p>
              NBC quickly became the broadcasting giant, earning nearly $2.2
              million in profits in 1930 alone (roughly $31 million in 2014
              dollars). The network was up against its main rival CBS, which
              began its own radio newscast just a few months after NBC. NBC’s
              success didn’t come without legal issues, however. In 1939, the
              newly formed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched an
              antitrust investigation of the network. Four years after the FCC
              ordered RCA to get rid of NBC entirely, the company opted to sell
              off its entire “blue” network in 1943. That "blue" network would
              later become known as the American Broadcast Company (ABC).

            <p>
              By the 1930s, radio news—and broadcast programs, more
              generally—were such a hit that established newspapers were seeing
              dramatic decreases in circulation. Networks began to establish
              their own permanent news bureaus in major cities. In fact, in
              1933, CBS started placing correspondents in every American city
              with a population of 20,000 or more, in addition to many foreign
              capitals. Radio journalism soon hinged on live coverage of
              everything from sporting events and political speeches, to major
              court trials.
            </p>
            <p>
              The popularity and expansion of broadcast news meant that
              journalists had new roles as commentators and on-air reporters.
              News radio became the go-to source of information, for stories at
              home and abroad. By 1939, a poll estimated that more than 25
              percent of Americans relied on the radio as their main source for
              news. A few years later, in 1946, it was up to more than 60
              percent. This was coupled with the introduction of broadcast
              advertising in 1922, making radio programming an incredibly
              profitable market—and a new communication force to be reckoned
              with. By 1928, the Republican Party was spending more than 20
              percent of its overall presidential campaign budget on radio
              advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              Broadcast news programs and journalists soon joined the rising
              ranks of radio entertainment personalities. Moreover, these men
              and women had a role in helping Americans engage with the news in
              a way they never had before—giving them a chance to hear a variety
              of opinions, engage with the news in real-time, and listen to and
              analyze politicians in a new, dynamic way.&nbsp;

              The development of the radio has it roots in trial and error, in
              experimentation with transmitting sounds, extending ranges, and
              pushing the limits of what radio could do. This experimental
              attitude did not end with Marconi, however. Though the basics of
              how we use radio today were established in the early 1900s,
              amateur experimentation with the medium continued through the
              twentieth century.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Before the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em>, amateur radio
              broadcasters were often unregulated. Users picked their own call
              letters and worked without a license. After
              the&nbsp;<em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;sank, and was unable to reach
              another ship’s radio operator for help because the receiver had
              been turned off for the evening, new radio laws were put into
              place. Part of the Radio Act of 1912, beyond mandating that radios
              had to be constantly monitored, created new licensing regulations.
              The bill essentially kicked amateur radio broadcasters off the
              professionally used and mandated long radio waves. That brought
              them back to the experimental level again, working on shorter
              wavelengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1922, amateur radio operators, pushing for recognition amidst
              rumors that the big networks were trying to silence them, issued a
              definition for themselves. They determined an amateur radio
              operator as "one who operates a radio station, transmitting or
              receiving, without pay or personal gain, merely for personal
              interest." Their better-known title, "ham" radio operators
              (originally a derisive label taken from the equally pejorative
              "ham actor"), gained popularity in the 1950s, along with a new
              rise in amateur radio operators. In a move to formally stake a
              claim on the airwaves, the first amateur radio satellite OSCAR
              (Orbiting Satellites Carrying Amateur Radio) was launched in 1961.

              With the rise of radio came new—and some much
              beloved—entertainment forms, now ready-for-broadcast. The
              development of the radio mirrored the rise of the gramophone and
              phonograph, which date back to the turn of the twentieth century.
              As music increasingly became a focus of radio programming in the
              1950s and 1960s, record stores let listeners buy singles or albums
              they heard on the radio for on-demand listening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entertainment forms like music, and even sporting events, were now
              easily accessible to anyone with a radio—letting people who might
              not be able to afford to see a game or show live get a chance to
              get in on the action. Sports were a particularly good fit for live
              radio, as they gave people a chance to listen to a game's
              play-by-play. This play-by-play approach by sports announcers and
              their color commentator sidekicks dates back to the very beginning
              of the radio, when Marconi used Morse code to broadcast the
              results of the America’s Cup back to the&nbsp;<em
                >New York Herald</em
              >&nbsp;newsroom. Soon, university football games, prizefights, and
              baseball games took to the airwaves. By 1922, the Yankees-Giants
              World Series drew in a record one million radio listeners. Some of
              the nation’s most recognizable radio personalities were sports
              announcers, including the Chicago Cubs' Harry Caray and New York
              sports anchor, Howard Cosell.

                Radio also meant that African Americans, who were still
                restricted by segregation laws throughout the country, could
                access entertainment that they were barred from seeing in
                person. In particular, the 1938 heavyweight-boxing match that
                pitted Joe Louis, the first black heavyweight champion, against
                a white German opponent named Max Schmeling, brought in a large
                African American audience. Boxing, like most sports in the
                United States, was segregated, so it was rare to have both black
                and white contenders in the same ring. Across the South
                especially, African Americans gathered around radios to tune
                into the fight. (Future US President Jimmy Carter remembers
                listening to the fight as a boy, and putting the radio up to the
                window so his black neighbors outside could hear it). The fight
                became one of the largest broadcasts of the decade.

            <p>
              Though radio broke down some barriers for African Americans,
              racism pervaded the broadcast industry and mitigated the ways that
              black entertainers had to work within and against its confines.
              And while radio did create larger audiences for the work of black
              musicians, from its inception, black musicians and their work
              played on the radio to primarily white audiences.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              For rural African Americans in the US South (which accounted for
              about 80 percent of the nation’s black population between WWI and
              WWII), access to radio itself had its limits. While more and more
              white families could afford radios, it was still a heavy financial
              burden for African Americans. A 1935 poll of sharecroppers living
              in North and South Carolina showed that few, if any, black
              families owned a radio. In the 1940s, while nearly 80 percent of
              white rural families nationwide owned radios, only about 20
              percent of rural blacks did. Even though radio broadcasters made
              some steps to integrate African American artists into their
              lineups, pre-WWII audiences were overwhelmingly white.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              At the same time, the racism prevalent throughout the country was
              also present in radio programming. African American men and women
              in the radio industry found stark limitations on what jobs they
              could or could not hold. For example, black actors were often
              confined to voicing black caricatures on radio dramas. Racist
              stereotypes, often derived from minstrel shows, were widespread
              during radio’s Golden Age programming.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              By the 1950s and 1960s, more localized programming, created for
              and by African Americans, helped create a stronger voice for
              blacks on the radio. Post WWII, marketers recognized that African
              Americans were a sizeable consumer market, and radio broadcasters
              took notice, too. New programming blocks aimed at black listeners
              were created. Many local urban stations made their home in Harlem
              and blacks began owning shares in Southern stations.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              NBC issued its new code of standards in 1951, which included
              “integration without identification,” regularly using African
              American actors in non-black roles. NBC said the new policy
              increased the use of black talent on the radio by 200 percent over
              the course of a single year. Moreover, the emergence of radio DJs
              in the 1960s and 1970s meant that popular rock, blues, and jazz
              music, which often featured African American musicians, were heard
              by a wider audience—both black and white—in a way never possible
              before.&nbsp;

              By the beginning of the 1950s, a host of newscasts and programs
              aired on TV network stations—most of which were the same big name
              networks from radio. Beyond the familiar NBC, CBS, and ABC call
              letters, in its early days television borrowed heavily from radio.
              Some of the staple radio dramas and serials made their way to
              television. Even the fifteen-minute format of news programs in
              television’s early days was modeled after radio newscasts.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              As the decade progressed, the medium changed, moving away from
              radio-style programming to the start of some of television’s most
              enduring programs: NBC’s <em>Today</em> debuted in 1952, and
              <em>The Tonight Show</em> in 1953. Sitcoms, which featured
              recurring characters, became hugely successful. Beyond that, a new
              and profitable market emerged—children’s television. While there
              were radio programs aimed at children before, now shows like ABC’s
              <em>The Mickey Mouse Club</em> gained immense popularity. It was
              an advertising boon for networks, too, who created blocks of
              scheduling just for children. Children became a new mass market.
              They saw, for example, Disney’s <em>Davy Crockett</em> on
              television and got their parents to buy $300 million dollars worth
              of merchandise, including the iconic coonskin cap.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              More than television just being a way to advertise new products to
              children, it was marketing the very medium itself. A 1950 study
              gauging the opinions of children, parents, and teachers saw a
              growing segment of children who wanted to pursue careers in new
              video-related fields. Indeed, television opened up a completely
              new job landscape for Americans looking to tap into the country’s
              next big communication medium.

              Television also changed the way the world interacted with the news
              and its leaders—just as its radio predecessor had done decades
              prior. The first major television news events were the 1952
              Democratic and Republican conventions. Walter Cronkite, one of the
              first television news anchors, covered the conventions for CBS. In
              future elections, television coverage became a major focus for the
              party conventions and soon, the race for president itself.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Many, in fact, credit television in part for the election of
              President John F. Kennedy. During a televised debate with Richard
              Nixon, Kennedy came across as a much more viable—and
              photogenic—candidate. In polls following the debate, Americans who
              watched on TV thought Kennedy won the debate. Those who listened
              on the radio considered Nixon the winner. But by 1960, television
              news was king. As President Lyndon B. Johnson said in 1968, “If
              I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost middle America.”
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              While television carved out a substantial role for itself in
              politics and entertainment, radio adapted. Where early radio was
              primarily one-sided, with a host talking to an audience, call in
              talk-shows emerged in the 1960s allowing listeners to interact
              with the content. Many of these new talk shows were political in
              nature, with conservative and liberal bents, appealing to more
              specialized audiences.&nbsp; The 1980s also saw the emergence of
              the “shock jock,” a DJ who pushed the boundaries of accepted
              speech and content on the radio.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Radio, in its many iterations, from “Top 40,” NPR, Rush Limbaugh,
              to satellite and Internet based programming, continues to adapt
              and find new audiences. As NBC’s vice president in charge of radio
              announced in 1954, “Radio didn’t die. It wasn’t even sick. It just
              had to be psychoanalyzed . . . .The public didn’t stop loving
              radio despite TV. It just started liking it in a different way—and
              radio went to the beach, to the park, the patio and the automobile
