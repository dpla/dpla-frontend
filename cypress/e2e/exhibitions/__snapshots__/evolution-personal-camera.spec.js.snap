              out a smartphone. However, that digital photo is the result of
              decades of experimentation and development, from first forays into
              bulky and difficult-to-use professional cameras to instant-photo
              Polaroids.</span

                >Since the advent and eventual commercialization of photography
                throughout the nineteenth century, cameras have continuously
                redefined the American public’s conception of how images and
                history can be captured and shared. Looking to the early cameras
                of the 1800s to today’s cell phones and social networking apps,
                this exhibition explores how the personal camera has shaped
                American consciousness and culture over the course of its
                development.

                >Early cameras were cumbersome, costly, and often required
                specialist knowledge of the devices and developing chemicals to
                use them correctly. Early film development processes, like
                tintypes and daguerreotypes, relied on potentially dangerous
                chemical interactions that were best handled in a controlled
                environment. For daguerreotype images, popular between 1840 and
                1860, the photographer put a sheet of copper, coated with silver
                and exposed to iodine vapor, into the camera. Once the sheet was
                exposed to light during the taking of the picture, the
                photographer used a mercury vapor to bring out the image, and
                then set it with salt.

              <span
                >Because the film process used highly toxic and often dangerous
                chemicals, photographs were almost exclusively taken by
                professionals until the twentieth century. Most permanent
                photography studios were located in major cities, but
                photographers with out-of-town clients would haul their
                equipment outside city limits in horse-drawn wagons. This
                equipment was more than just a camera, which itself was often a
                large, accordioned box with a lens on one end, plus the glass or
                copper plates used to take the image. Photographers had to bring
                along the darkroom and developing chemicals as well.</span

              <span
                ><span
                  >Early cameras also had a very slow shutter speed, meaning
                  that the shutter remained open exposing the plate to light for
                  a longer period of time. Though early daguerreotype images
                  required an exposure of around twenty minutes, by the early
                  1840s it had been reduced to about twenty seconds. Even so,
                  photography subjects needed to remain completely still for
                  long periods of time for the image to come out crisp and not
                  blurred by their movement. Sometimes squirming children were
                  put into restraints for the duration of the photo shoot. This
                  need for stillness made posing for a picture a serious
                  business, so the practice of smiling for the camera did not
                  become standard until the 1920s, when technological
                  advancements in camera production allowed for shortened
                  exposure times.</span

                >Due to several breakthrough developments in camera production,
                photography soon began to shift from a professionally-dominated
                field to an amateur-friendly pastime. The invention of a gelatin
                dry plate in 1871, for example, helped photographers create
                quality images faster and more easily than ever before. It
                eliminated the need for a tripod and strict posing, allowing for
                more candid photography.</span

              <span
                >While Eastman Kodak Company was not the only business producing
                cameras at the end of the nineteenth century, they spearheaded
                many of the crucial innovations that led to modern photography.
                Kodak made its consumer debut with the easy-to-use Box Camera in
                1888, using the advertising slogan “you press the button – we do
                the rest.” The camera had a fixed-focus lens and one shutter
                speed, making it easy to use.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >This was followed the next year by roll film, which was
                introduced as an alternative to bulky photographic plates. Photo
                processing became standardized as well. The Kodak Box Camera was
                even pre-loaded with a hundred photos-worth of film. Once the
                exposures were done, users would send the camera back to the
                manufacturer to be processed and re-loaded. In 1902, the Kodak
                Developing Machine, which eliminated the need for a formal
                darkroom, hit the market. This machine allowed photographers to
                develop their pictures at home, making the camera ready for
                everyone.</span

                >The inventor and founder of the Polaroid Corporation, Edwin H.
                Land, developed the first instant camera as a hobby during World
                War II. After the war, the growth of the American economy made
                it possible for new industries to flourish. One of these
                industries was instant photography.

                >Polaroid photography focused on minimizing the time between
                taking the photograph and viewing the image. However, the first
                Polaroid camera, which debuted in 1948, still relied on the
                photographer to time the development of the film, pull out the
                print to burst a pod of developing chemicals, and peel away the
                top film. These first film prints were in sepia-tone, followed
                by black-and-white prints in 1950. The Polaroid company actually
                published a magazine advertisement for their black-and-white
                film before it was available, and their employees worked quickly
                to meet public demand.</span

                >As instant camera technology progressed, it became possible for
                the prints to develop within a minute before the eyes of the
                user (oftentimes, people would wave Polaroids in the air to
                encourage faster image development). After the popular
                black-and-white prints came the peel-apart color prints in 1963,
                and non-peel-apart color prints followed in 1972. By 1977, the
                height of its popularity, Polaroid held two-thirds of the
                instant camera market, despite competition from Kodak.</span

                  as video cameras and 35-millimeter cameras became smaller and
                  cheaper. Ultimately, Polaroid’s innovations in instant
                  photography created a public desire which would lead to their
                  own demise at the hands of an even more instant medium</span

                century has blurred the lines between image creation and
                communication. Rapidly evolving technological advancements that
                allow for more images to be stored at high qualities on small
                devices have made it possible for people to carry massive
                photographic archives right on their smart phones, and then
                share them via social media.

                  >Before the digital photography revolution, photographs were
                  taken more sparingly. Milestone events, like birthday parties,
                  graduations ceremonies, and family reunions, were more likely
                  to be shot than ordinary day-to-day subjects. However, with
                  the widespread use of camera phones, everything from the
                  significant to the minute can be documented in real time and
                  then shared with the entire world.</span

                >The mass replacement of film cameras with digital ones has not
                only changed the way people take and view photos, but also the
                photography profession as a whole. The popularity of digital
                cameras has led to the sharp decline of film processing and
                production. Camera stores, film companies, and photo labs are
                quickly becoming obsolete. Companies such as Polaroid have
                shuttered their film stock plants, and many manufacturers are no
                longer making film cameras for the general public. The digital
                nature of file sharing has dramatically minimized the need for
                physical prints of photographs, and photo processing businesses
                are feeling the impact.

                  >In terms of training, many universities still offer
                  traditional photography programs, but digital photography
                  rules the roost. Darkrooms are nostalgically viewed as
                  “old-school,” rather than as cutting-edge. Because editing
                  software like Photoshop enables amateurs with computer access
                  to manipulate and enhance their own images, professional
                  photographers are also seeing a decline in demand. In 2013 the
                  Chicago <em>Sun-Times</em> axed all twenty-eight of their
                  on-staff photojournalists, saying they would be replaced with
                  iPhone wielding reporters. For better or worse, digital
                  cameras have forever altered the landscape of modern
                  photography.</span

                >Despite the complexities of image development, photography
                became popular very quickly, due in part to its lower cost
                compared to that of the formal painted or sculpted portraits of
                the time. However, hiring an expert with the proper equipment
                was still a costly process, which mean that those who could
                afford photography services typically only did so for special
                occasions, like weddings and engagements. Photographs were also
                often taken to create commemorative keepsakes of young men
                before they went off to war.

                  >During the Victorian era in the mid- to late-nineteenth
                  century, photography was also employed to capture images of
                  the recently deceased. This practice, known as </span
                ><em>memento mori</em
                ><span
                  >, was a way for the bereaved to memorialize loved ones, and
                  often served as the only visual keepsake of a lost family
                  member. In particular, infants and children were most often
                  subjects of post-mortem photography, as child mortality rates
                  were high during the development and rise of early
                  photography. Most subjects were posed in seated, lifelike
                  positions, although rarely subjects were photographed in
                  coffins. Children were often posed with their surviving family
                  members (sometimes in the only portrait of the full family
                  together) or with toys and flowers. Sometimes, daguerreotypes
                  were edited with a rose-hued tint, adding color to the cheeks
                  of the subjects. As it became possible to produce multiple
                  copies of an image, post-mortem images were commonly sent as
                  keepsakes to extended family members.

                >The modern camera developed over time through the invention and
                innovation of a number of experimenters. Joseph Niépce, though
                often called the grandfather of modern photography for his
                light-based camera obscura developments, was just one of many
                trailblazers in the field.

                >Thomas Wedgwood, who developed the concept of capturing images
                with light-sensitive chemicals. William Henry Fox Talbot
                developed processes for making those photographs permanent,
                using light-sensitive silver chloride and silver iodide. The
                brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière experimented with color
                photography process, and patented the color plate as part of
                their “Autochrome Lumiere” process. In conjunction with their
                work on photography, the Lumière brothers were also pioneers in
                cinematography.

                  >By the mid-1860s, the photography field was rapidly
                  commercializing, with chemically coated papers and special
                  lenses available for public purchase. Stereograph cards
                  (viewable through a pair of goggles, similar to the modern
                  View-Master toy) became wildly popular. It was estimated that
                  nearly every middle- and upper-class Victorian home had a
                  stereoscope and a collection of cards, offering views from
                  around the globe. A portrait of Queen Victoria of England,
                  herself a photography enthusiast, was a popular stereograph
                  image. Soon, appreciation for specific photographers and their
                  work rose, as did the demand for more affordable copies of
                  their images.</span

                >Introduced in 1900, the Kodak Box Brownie boasted simple,
                straightforward usage at an affordable price. The first model
                was a cardboard box camera with a simple lens that printed on
                roll film. The camera was priced at just one dollar, which meant
                that many Americans could buy into the photography craze.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >While previous camera ads had only been printed in professional
                and hobbyists journals, ads for Brownie Cameras were published
                in popular magazines along with a yearly advertising contest
                that encouraged both amateurs and professionals to participate.
                Throughout the early to mid-twentieth century, Kodak even
                engaged children through giveaways and other gimmicks (including
                debuting a line of Brownie cameras marketed at Boy Scouts),
                ensuring that youngsters became some of the camera’s most
                fervent users. Within the first year, Kodak sold over 150,000
                Brownies. They would continue to offer new, innovative versions
                over the next several decades.</span

                  >By the time Kodak celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in
                  1930, the American love affair with the camera was already in
                  full swing. The popularity of the small, unassuming box that
                  gave ordinary people the power to record their lives through
                  images meant that history was now not only textual, but
                  pictorial as well.</span

                marketing photography as a pastime accessible to all Americans.
                The point-and-click camera had long been the centerpiece of
                Kodak’s technological platform, but it was not until the
                introduction of the Brownie Camera that personal photography
                took off.</span

              <span
                >The image quality left something to be desired, but the Brownie
                Camera enabled Americans to develop their own pictorial
                histories, regardless of their previous photography experience.
                Families no longer needed to hire professional photographers for
                formal portraits. The price of the Brownie meant they could
                instead buy their own cameras and take the images themselves.
                Everything that had previously been impossible to capture was
                now recordable and shareable.</span

                  >This leap in technological accessibility led to a new type of
                  photographic images, known as “snapshots.” Instead of relying
                  on professional techniques, this new kind of amateur image
                  photography focused on taking quick, spontaneous shots that
                  captured everyday life. Traditional events like holidays and
                  graduations, as well as candid family moments, were regular
                  snapshot subjects. Kodak built branding around the everyday
                  activities documented by the snapshot, coining the phrase
                  “Kodak moment.” These messy, but memorable, photos altered the
                  ways individuals understood and communicated with images and
                  set the tone for how we perceive photographs today.</span

                >The invention of instant photography, popularized by the
                Polaroid camera, marked an exciting new shift in the photography
                industry. People could take pictures on impulse and then moments
                later have a developed photo. Unlike other types of film,
                Polaroid prints did not produce a negative and (before the
                development of digital scanners) could not be reproduced.
                Rather, they were solely images “of the moment.”

              <span
                >Polaroid advertisements in the mid twentieth-century wowed
                buyers with the promise that they could “take and show party
                pictures while the fun is going on.” They also emphasized the
                use of their cameras in social settings, with advertisements
                saying, “You’re the life of the party with a Polaroid Land
                Camera.” In 1976, Editor-in-Chief of the </span
              ><span>British Journal of Photography</span
              ><span
                >, Geoffrey Crawley, observed that taking instant photos had
                morphed picture taking into a communal activity that could be
                enjoyed amongst groups of friends. Writer Peggy Sealfon also
                noted that instant cameras could be used as icebreakers, and
                “[w]ould motivate people to do unexpected things, just to see
                the immediate record of their behavior.”</span

                  >Polaroid’s immediately-viewable images were the world’s
                  introduction to the concept of instant images and a precursor
                  to digital photography. Despite the rise of digital photos,
                  Polaroid prints continue to enjoy a worldwide cult status as
                  aesthetically distinctive because of their iconic white
                  borders and particular size.

                >Digital cameras have completely transformed modern perceptions
                of image sharing. Before the digital era, people tended to be
                more selective about the images they captured, due to the costs
                of film, processing and printing. Now that digital cameras have
                nearly eliminated film from the equation, however, no image is
                off limits. Individuals with digital cameras or smartphones can
                capture sacred moments, silly moments, and everything
                in-between. The forward-facing lenses on camera phones, which
                allow photographers to easily shoot self-portraits, have given
                rise to the coining of a new word, “selfie.”

                  >Voted Oxford Dictionaries’ 2013 Word of the Year, a “selfie”
                  is defined as any “photograph that one has taken of oneself,
                  typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and shared via
                  social media.” Social media plays a huge role in the way
                  digital images are shared. With websites like Facebook,
                  Tumblr, and Flickr, and apps such as Instagram and Snapchat,
                  digital snapshots have become instantly consumable.</span
