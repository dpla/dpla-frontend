              >As the United States began the most deadly conflict in its
              history, the American Civil War, it was also laying the groundwork
              for one of its greatest achievements in transportation. The First
              Transcontinental Railroad, approved by Congress in the midst of
              war, helped connect the country in ways never before possible.
              Americans could travel from coast to coast with speed, changing
              how Americans lived, traded, and communicated while disrupting
              ways of life practiced for centuries by Native American
              populations. The coast-to-coast railroad was the result of the
              work of thousands of Americans, many of whom were Chinese
              immigrant laborers
              <span
                >who worked under discriminatory pressures and for lower wages
                than their Irish counterparts</span
              >. These laborers braved incredibly harsh conditions to lay
              thousands of miles of track. That track</span

              With the discovery of gold in California shortly after its
              annexation, the untapped wealth of the American West spurred
              interest in westward expansion&nbsp;at home and abroad. By the
              time President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railway Act in 1862 to
              establish federal support for the construction of the
              Transcontinental Railroad, there was no question that a railway
              would help people and goods traveling west do so more quickly and
              safely, with the added benefit of nationwide geographic and
              economic growth as new towns sprang up near the train’s route.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >The onset of the Civil War helped decide that route, since
                after secession, northern lawmakers faced little opposition to a
                route based in the north. The federal government then contracted
                the Central Pacific Railroad in Sacramento and the Union Pacific
                Railroad in Omaha to start laying tracks, supported by
                government land grants and bonds.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                ><span
                  >In addition to this support, each railroad company received a
                  bounty for each mile of track laid. The Central Pacific and
                  Union Pacific would each be compensated with $16,000 for each
                  mile of track in the Sierra Nevadas and east of the Rockies.
                  Once the railroads entered the mountains, they would rake in
                  $32,000 for every mile of track they put down. The quicker
                  each company put down track, the more money they would make.
                  This structure of compensation started a seven-year race
                  between the companies to see who could lay the most
                  track.</span

            <h2>Laborers</h2>
            <p>
              As construction began on the Central Pacific Line, railroad
              organizers were finding it impossible to retain the thousands of
              workers needed to lay track. White, mostly Irish, workers would
              quit after building up savings to seek their fortunes in the gold
              fields. The Central Pacific questioned where they might find the
              sustained manpower needed to finish the job.
            </p>
            <p>
              For them, the answer lay in the Chinese, who had experienced great
              difficulties in California after emigrating during the Gold Rush
              of 1849. They were barred from participating in public life, yet
              had to pay extra taxes. Politicians, notably head of the Central
              Pacific and Governor of California Leland Stanford, began running
              on anti-Chinese platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chinese workers were first brought to railroad work to send a
              message to Irish workers that they were expendable. Yet work from
              the Chinese gave the Central Pacific great returns on the meager
              $30 a month it paid each laborer and thus they eventually
              comprised 80 percent of the workers on the line. The Chinese would
              brave the hazardous conditions of tunneling and accomplish
              incredible feats of track laying, including one period where they
              put down 10 miles in 12 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              A more diverse group was responsible for the construction of the
              Union Pacific line, including Irish Civil War veterans and newly
              freed slaves looking for paying jobs in the more progressive West.
              Mormons also comprised a significant portion of the Union Pacific
              workforce because of a collective desire to see the railroad
              incorporate Utah into the rest of the nation.

                >The requirements of building the railroad resulted in
                significant devastation of the forests of the American West.
                Lumber was needed for railroad ties, as well as fuel and shelter
                for workers who needed to cook and stay warm during year-round
                work on the railroad. Snow sheds, which protected the exposed
                tracks during the winter months in the mountains, were
                continuously constructed and dismantled. Support beams for
                tunnels and bridges were needed to protect workers and the
                trains. Even after the railroad was constructed, large amounts
                of wood were required, including on some areas of track that
                Union Pacific and the Central Pacific had hastily built and
                planned to go back and fix. These areas not only led to the
                derailment of trains, but required more logging to make the
                necessary repairs.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The train not only enabled the migration of people, it also
                allowed Americans to conquer terrains and remote environments
                previously impassable and uninhabitable and goods necessary to
                support large populations to be shipped with lightning speed. As
                sparsely populated areas grew into towns and cities, they began
                encroaching upon once “wild” areas. The completion of the
                Transcontinental Railroad dramatically catalyzed the development
                of the West, a process that both extended settlement and mining
                into otherwise unreachable areas and caused desertification (or,
                dry and arid conditions) in places along the route.</span

              <span
                >The Transcontinental Railroad was planned and construction
                began during the Civil War, which gave northern Congressmen
                reason to oppose plans for a southern route. As southerners
                resigned their seats in the legislature, Republican lawmakers
                chose a northern route that would insulate the railroad from the
                conflict and ensure that northern states benefitted from the
                line more than their southern counterparts. Designed to punish
                the South for the secession movement of 1861, the North’s
                transcontinental plans had strategic value as well. As the war
                dragged on, the perception of the railroad as an asset for the
                North continued to grow.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Although the railroad was not completed until four years after
                the Civil War, its potential value to the war effort in the
                North cannot be understated. A completed railroad would have
                enabled the North to further capitalize on military and economic
                advantages over the South. Since only 9,500 miles of track had
                been previously laid south of the Mason-Dixon line, as opposed
                to 22,000 north of it, the North maintained a large advantage in
                terms of moving troops, relocating raw materials, and
                transporting food and other supplies to the front lines. With a
                blockade that restricted international shipments of goods and
                supplies to the Confederacy, southerners were not only prevented
                from building new railroads, but were forced to pull rails to
                melt into bullets or to make repairs to more important railway
                lines.</span

              <span
                >As impressive an achievement as the Transcontinental Railroad
                was, it also signified the beginning of the end for the
                “untamed” American West. Hunting for sport became more popular,
                as passengers on trains hunted herds of bison as they rode
                across the Great Plains. These train-hunts were designed to both
                provide entertainment for passengers and to reduce food supplies
                for Native Americans, who relied on the bison as a staple for
                survival. Since Native Americans were some of the biggest
                opponents to westward expansion, lawmakers and railroad pundits
                alike supported these cruel hunting practices. Unfortunately for
                both the bison and Native Americans, these wasteful practices
                were incredibly successful in driving both populations to the
                edge of annihilation.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The Transcontinental Railroad also commercialized parts of the
                agricultural west. Forcibly relocating dozens of Native American
                tribes and seizing their land opened land for pioneer farmers.
                Areas of the Great Plains that were previously considered
                unsuitable for farming were reallocated by the Homestead Act of
                1862. As a trade for government subsidization, farmers that
                purchased this new, cheap farmland were expected to work the
                semi-arid grassland of the High Plains to repay their
                debts.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Areas that could not be reached by railroad also experienced a
                sharp decline in population. As the costs of supplying plains
                and desert communities continued to rise, families moved to
                greener, more central states. Abandoned communities, isolated by
                land and resources, created ghost towns across the West.
                Although the railroad provided opportunities for growth for
                towns lucky enough to have access, most settlements that relied
                on wagons to transport goods found that they could not pay the
                costs necessary to ensure basic survival.</span

                they altered the original transcontinental route to add more
                miles for profit. Durant also had a habit of withholding wages
                from the men working on the railway, leading to strikes. It is
                only fitting that the Union Pacific developed a scandalous
                reputation and the infamous nickname “Hell on Wheels” for
                Durant’s tactics, as well as the saloons, brothels, and gambling
                houses that followed the laborers as they built the
                railroad.</span

              The Central Pacific was a different kind of hell. The “Big Four,”
              a group of big businessmen, philanthropists, and railroad tycoons
              at the helm of the Central Pacific, were looking to turn a big
              profit, and wanted to ensure that their railroad would connect
              California to the East Coast. This was by no means an easy task.
              The Central Pacific was only able to put down 100 miles over the
              first five years of the project as the steep and treacherous
              Sierra Nevada mountain range proved to be a formidable obstacle.

                  possible in order to earn more money—neither wanted to lose
                  even a mile to the competition. However, the race was
                  ultimately a runaway victory for the Union Pacific, which was
                  able to lay 1,085 miles of track to the 690 miles put down by
                  the Central Pacific. Ultimately, the 1,900 miles of track
                  challenged the strength and courage of the tens of thousands
                  of men who laid it hand by hand through rough terrain,
                  difficult climates, and the often unwelcoming populations who
                  lived along its path.</span

                >Although, by the 1860s, Native Americans had signed away the
                rights to much of their land in treaties with the federal
                government, they likely never imagined that a disruptive and
                massive system like the railroad would be constructed through
                their traditional hunting grounds. The construction of the
                Transcontinental Railroad had dire consequences for the native
                tribes of the Great Plains, forever altering the landscape and
                causing the disappearance of once-reliable wild game. The
                railroad was probably the single biggest contributor to the loss
                of the bison, which was particularly traumatic to the Plains
                tribes who depended on it for everything from meat for food to
                skins and fur for clothing, and more.</span

              <span
                >Tribes increasingly came into conflict with the railroad as
                they attempted to defend their diminishing resources.
                Additionally, the railroad brought white homesteaders who farmed
                the newly tamed land that had been the bison’s domain. Tribes of
                the Plains found themselves at cultural odds with the whites
                building the railroad and settlers claiming ownership over land
                that had previously never been owned. In response, Native
                Americans sabotaged the railroad and attacked white settlements
                supported by the line, in an attempt to reclaim the way of life
                that was being taken from them. If they were not taking aim at
                the railroad tracks and machinery, they would attack the workers
                and abscond with their livestock. Ultimately the tribes of the
                Plains were unsuccessful in preventing the loss of their
                territory and hunting resources. Their struggle serves as a
                poignant example of how the Transcontinental Railroad could
                simultaneously destroy one way of life as it ushered in
                another.</span

                now only required a matter of days between San Francisco, on the
                West Coast, and Chicago, the railroad’s eastern hub. Passengers
                marveled at the speed and relative safety that traveling by
                train afforded them across regions of the country that only
                decades before were being explored for the first time. Though
                there were occasional derailments due to shoddy construction,
                the Transcontinental Railroad was instantly the most secure way
                to transport passengers and goods to the West Coast and
                back</span

                  >For immigrants to the United States, the Transcontinental
                  Railroad presented an opportunity to seek their fortunes in
                  the West. There, they found more opportunity than the port
                  cities of the East Coast, where discrimination kept immigrants
                  living in urban squalor. The open West and legislation like
                  the Homestead Act of 1862, gave foreigners (and many other
                  Americans, too) the ability to stake claims to their own land,
                  provide for their families, and take control of their
                  destinies in ways that the densely populated East could not.
                  The railroad companies quickly identified these populations as
                  an ideal customer base and developed aggressive campaigns
                  marketing the potential of the West to encourage migration and
                  create more business.</span

              <span
                >A route through the Donner Pass and Dutch Flats was identified
                as the safest and easiest route for the Central Pacific Railroad
                to traverse the Sierra Nevadas. But railroad crews had to find
                their own way through the mountains when going over or around
                them was impossible. Over a dozen tunnels were constructed to
                allow the Central Pacific to pass through the Sierras, requiring
                thousands of laborers and a great deal of engineering
                ingenuity.</span

              <span
                >One of the most challenging tunnels built by the Central
                Pacific Railroad was Tunnel No. 6, the Summit Tunnel, which ran
                through the top of the Donner Pass. Early snows defeated the
                first attempt to build it. While construction crews began
                digging at both the east and west ends, two additional crews dug
                down from above the tunnel’s route to pull out the debris
                through vertical shafts. The measurements used to plan the
                passage of the Summit Tunnel were so accurate that, having
                drilled through 1,659 feet of rock, the teams were only two
                inches off when they finally connected the eastern and western
                portals.</span

              <span
                >Another technological advancement that aided the completion of
                the Summit Tunnel was nitroglycerin. Railroad engineers used
                this explosive compound mixed on site to move large sections of
                rock and earth, which was quicker than digging by hand. The
                unstable nature of nitroglycerin continued to be a problem
                during the course of Summit Tunnel construction, causing an
                untold number of laborer deaths. As a result, it was not used on
                the remainder of the Central Pacific Line.</span

                >While the railroad was built in a divisive era, its completion
                helped unite the nation after the Civil War. Arguably its
                greatest contribution was that it allowed for people and goods
                to travel from coast to coast at unprecedented speeds. Prior to
                construction, cross-country travel required long treks over
                dangerous land and sea. Travelers could trek for months across
                the American interior, over the Great Plains, through the Rocky
                Mountains, and on through the Sierra Nevadas, before ever
                reaching California. Even by sea, migrants had to spend several
                weeks sailing around South America and the treacherous Cape Horn
                before reaching San Francisco. Whereas countless lives were lost
                by land and by sea, the railroad expedited cross-country travel
                and made it safer for westward expansion.</span

              <span
                >The Transcontinental Railroad also served as a strong symbol of
                American achievement. This was important as the country
                continued to rebuild after the Civil War. Not only had the US
                built a transportation system that enabled travel “from sea to
                shining sea,” but it had also conquered the terrain and the
                elements of a still wild West. As the country set forth united,
                railroad workers laid the last railroad tie at Promontory Point,
                Utah, sealing the ceremony with a gold spike to commemorate the
                achievement. The image of the golden spike remains one of the
                most iconic of the nineteenth century, although an ordinary
                spike did eventually replace the ceremonial gold one. In fact,
                the railroad had to replace ties at a rate of one per week as
                souvenir seekers chipped away at the railroad for a chance to
                own a piece of history.</span

                Americans, the Transcontinental Railroad did create
                opportunities for communication and knowledge sharing never
                before possible. Poems, including Walt Whitman’s “Passage to
                India,” novels, and films were inspired by the new possibilities
                of the cross-country railroad. News, scientific discourse, and
                culture could travel from one side of the country to the other
                at new speeds. So could goods, with $50 million in freight
                traveling the rail line in its first ten years of operation.
                With the success of the original transcontinental route, tracks
                were laid to connect even more parts of the country. That
                original route, however, is still partly in use today. The
                Amtrak “California Zephyr” train travels via the first
                Transcontinental Railroad from Sacramento to Nevada.</span
