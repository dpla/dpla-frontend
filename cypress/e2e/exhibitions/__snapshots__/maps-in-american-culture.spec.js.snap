            From the earliest days of settlement and migration, the people of
            North America have relied on maps and mapping to understand their
            environment and place within it.&nbsp;Maps have helped Americans
            prospect investments, comprehend war, and plan leisure in places
            unknown. As Americans have used maps to explore the U.S., capitalize
            on its resources, and displace its Native peoples, maps have shaped
            American cultural ideas about travel, place, and ownership.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exhibit explores the cultural and historic impact of mapping
            through four specific moments in American history: migration along
            the Oregon Trail, the rise of the lumber industry, the Civil War,
            and the popularization of the automobile and individual tourism. It
            concludes with a look at maps in the age of computers, the Internet,
            and beyond. These moments demonstrate the influence maps have had
            over how Americans imagine, exploit, and interact with national
            geographies and local places.

              What began as an informal network of trails created by Native
              Americans to trade and hunt was expanded by the expeditions of
              prominent explorers, including Meriwether Lewis, William Clark,
              and John Jacob Astor to become the migration paths of America’s
              settlers and later some of the roads and highways that traverse
              the country today. Early traders, mapmakers, and surveyors
              provided descriptions and rudimentary maps to people living in the
              East that piqued the public imagination. Fur traders, such as
              Jedediah Smith and Kit Carson, later expanded American settlers'
              knowledge of the Western half of the continent by sharing
              experiences from their trapping expeditions. Missionaries used
              this information to venture into the northwest to found churches
              in the 1830s. Large-scale migration into the Oregon Territory
              began in 1840, when the trail, which would become known as the
              “Oregon Trail,” was still faint and maps were scarce.

                >The end of the Revolutionary War in 1783 marked the beginning
                of a new era. American colonists, having proved their strength
                against England, were determined to expand and increase their
                national wealth. As part of their push west, business
                prospectors and investors began to explore the American
                continent with an eye towards harnessing its natural treasures.
                The landscape, virtually overflowing with wild animals, mines
                and mineral deposits, countless fresh water bodies, vast
                expanses of forests, and potential farmland, was quickly
                surveyed and mapped. Investors saw these natural resources as
                theirs for the taking, ready to be seized, developed, and
                exploited for profit.

              American life was literally built on timber. Its utility—for
              construction, heating, furniture, tools, and other everyday
              contrivances—made it particularly attractive to investors as the
              West opened up in the nineteenth century. Maps of the era reveal
              this fixation on identifying timber-rich lands that could be
              logged to fill the ever-growing need for wood by the rapidly
              multiplying American states.

                Midwest, to the frontier in the Mountain West, lumber appeared
                limitless. Settlers saw large forests as even larger dollar
                signs, and, like other natural resources, maps were created to
                show investors where their money was going and from whence their
                profits came.</span

              The presence of lumberyards in major towns throughout the country
              indicated the widespread domestic need for wood. Local use was not
              the end of the story however. By the early-twentieth century, the
              U.S. lumber exports were supplying large markets throughout the
              western world, in large part due to careful mapping, burgeoning
              financial investment, and the growth of national
              infrastructure.&nbsp;

            <p>
              In the mid-nineteenth century, America’s division over slavery
              quickly escalated into the American Civil War, and with the war
              came a new appreciation for maps. These maps of wartime and
              national conflict served many purposes for the people of the
              United States, and were published by national journals such as
              <em>Harpers</em>, local presses, federal and state governments,
              and independent mapmakers. Many maps were purely utilitarian. But
              even those could be beautiful. Whatever their visual quality, maps
              served to describe and define new confederacies or lost ground,
              locate population groups such as slaves or enemy combatants, and
              even memorialize military strategies, battles, and heroes. In a
              country being torn apart, maps became representative of the grim
              realities of war and the division between North and South.

                travel for Americans meant taking the train, trolley, or
                standard horse and carriage. Traveling by road was not for the
                faint of heart and was considered a potentially dangerous
                adventure, limited to those with a purpose.</span

                  >In the early twentieth century, the motorcar was a rich man’s
                  toy and road conditions were often dismal. In the 1920s, as
                  cars became more available to the average citizen, road
                  conditions improved and leisure travel increased in
                  popularity. Maps became readily available at gas stations and
                  were often made free by companies that would profit from car,
                  fuel, and related commodities. Auto clubs also provided maps
                  for a subscription fee. The Automobile Association of America
                  (A.A.A.) perfected route-specific, spiral-bound maps called
                  “TripTik” travel planners, which continue to be produced for
                  their members today but saw their heyday during pre-GPS guided
                  road trips. They included not just routes, but also road
                  conditions and improvements, attractions, and other points of
                  interest. They were highly detailed and heavy with text. This
                  created a boom in road map creation that continued until the
                  gas shortages of the 1970s.</span

                  flight maps that assist computer pilots and entertain
                  long-distance air travelers, urban mapping applications that
                  can identify crime, gas prices, and apartment rentals, and

                century were advised to keep their wagonloads light, so heavy
                atlases were left at home, with guidebooks and newspaper
                articles often serving as substitutes. Detailed maps such as the </span

                navigational tools. Rather, wagon parties often hired
                experienced guides, sometimes former fur trappers, who knew the
                journey well and could help them make the crossing. The first
                major wagon train of this nature departed from St. Louis in
                1843, under the direction of John Gantt, and contained between
                700 and 1,000 emigrants.</span

                the press of his day as “The Pathfinder,” undertook several
                westward expeditions in the 1840s to survey and create maps of
                the western United States. His first expedition began in 1842
                and was succeeded in the following year by a more rigorous
                expedition with a crew of surveyors and cartographers. This
                expedition, along with two subsequent forays, provided a wealth
                of details about what is now known as the Oregon Trail.</span

                the 2,200-mile Oregon Trail. As use increased, the need for
                experienced guides declined with the rise of accurate maps and
                no less important, the well-worn wagon-wheel ruts that new
                travelers could use to make their way west.</span

                locations of native populations along the route, including major
                tribes such as the Cheyenne and the Pawnee. Like other
                settlements in American history, the push westward brought Anglo
                migrants and native populations into contact through business
                and trade, often causing tensions&nbsp;between migrant visions
                of prosperity and the Native’s own values and beliefs. By the
                mid-nineteenth century, a number of these encounters led to
                violence.</span

                in the mid-nineteenth century. Mormon settlers emigrated to Utah
                beginning in 1847 to escape religious persecution. Their route
                and destination were inspired in part by John C. Fremont’s maps
                published earlier in the decade. Between 1847 and 1860, over
                43,000 Mormon settlers followed what is now known as the Mormon
                Trail into Utah.</span

                >In 1848, gold found in California’s American River sparked
                frenzy, prompting thousands to rush to California to seek their
                fortune. Maps played a valuable role in directing emigrants to
                their prospects in the West. The ”49ers” crossed through
                portions of the Oregon Trail, coupled with a route discovered by
                Kit Carson into the American River Valley. Other settlers
                followed the Truckee Route into the Sacramento Valley. Once they
                made it to California, regional maps provided more specific
                information about (and often marketed) “desirable” locations.
                Towns sprouted up along routes heading west and within the new
                western territories. Many modern roads would be paved along the
                same routes traveled by settlers in the nineteenth century and
                the native peoples who first walked them centuries before.</span

                  American populations onto reservations, in effect changing
                  American geography. The tribes’ ecological and spiritual
                  relationships with the land, including its forests, often made
                  them protective and territorial in the face of industrial
                  pressures. Maps once depicted large American regions with a
                  general identification of native populations. Once tribes were
                  relocated to very specific areas, their resources were
                  suddenly available to industrialists, and maps evolved to
                  cover the locations and boundaries of the newly depopulated
                  lands as well as reservations. The mapping of reservations,
                  along with built infrastructure like railroads, became, in
                  effect, an act of “taming” the American landscape during the
                  late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

            <p>
              By the turn of the twentieth century, the American railway system
              extended across the entire continent. Maps visualizing the lines
              of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and the North Pacific Railway
              showcased timber-laden regions as both economic and natural
              wonders. Similar to the dusty miners of the gold rush, migrant
              workers took to the West, riding the railroad across the country,
              where they hoped to make their fortunes in large lumber outfits.
              The proliferation of lumber industries in the Upper Midwest,
              inland Northwest, and the West Coast sparked the rise of a
              “lumberjack culture.” These were iconic axe- and saw-wielding
              strongmen, who worked in the deepest forests bringing down the
              largest trees to keep America warm and working. The job was not
              easy or safe, and special insurance was often available to those
              brave individuals who took up the task.

            <p>
              Prior to and throughout the war, maps were created to illustrate
              the division between slave-holding and free states. In some cases,
              maps provided specific population percentages of slaves within
              southern states. Often maps merely revealed the division as a
              binary between the North and the South, starkly illustrating the
              geography of slavery. In some cases, due to the uncertainty of the
              war’s outcome, this approach to mapmaking showed up in prominent
              publications, including the <em>1857 Atlas</em> by Alexander Keith
              Johnston. In other cases, maps moved beyond the Mason-Dixon Line,
              polarizing the division of eastern states with those territories
              to the West. Different levels of granularity and precision allowed
              mappers to offer insight into to national, regional, state, and
              county-level demographics, providing information about a variety
              of communities and a range of political opinions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast to these published, widely circulated maps, other maps
              created to guide fleeing slaves to freedom existed long before the
              Civil War, but continued to be utilized until emancipation. They
              conveyed sensitive, and potentially dangerous, information and
              were available only to a select few. Underground Railroad maps, in
              particular, indicated “secure” routes and “safe” houses that would
              enable fleeing slaves to find shelter in northern states and
              Canada.

                the national highway system, the twentieth century saw a large
                increase in personal leisure travel. Events such as World's
                Fairs and the rise of national sports leagues, as well as the
                creation of ambitious entertainment destinations like Disneyland
                and other amusement parks, brought about new types of maps

                given area to help plan transit routes, souvenir maps, created
                for regions or specific destinations, were designed to be both
                fun and functional. Cartoon imagery, photographs, and other art
                depicted popular tourist sites, local flora and fauna, and
                geographic highlights. Instead of purchasing these prior to a
                trip, travelers received them at their destination. Souvenir
                maps served the dual purpose of being a visually appealing
                keepsake as well a promotional tool to recruit more visitors.

                travel in twentieth-century America, the realities of
                segregation limited options for travelers of color, reflected a
                larger culture of inequality. Prior to and during the Civil
                Rights Movement, segregation laws persisted throughout many
                areas in the country, while in others, climates of
                discrimination and violence without legal grounding limited
                access to businesses, lodging, and recreation. For many
                non-white travelers, reference materials and word-of-mouth
                recommendations were required to map a safe route across

                  technology, combined with a new interstate network of reliable
                  roads, gave Americans a dizzying array of travel choices.
                  Trains got faster and more comfortable. Long-distance bus
                  companies were born for both everyday and tourist-specific
                  transportation. Cars got bigger and were designed to travel
                  longer distances. And airlines were a traveler’s dream,

                  crisscrossing the sky each day.</span
