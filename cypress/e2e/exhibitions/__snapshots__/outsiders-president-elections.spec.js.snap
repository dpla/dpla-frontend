              >Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, a black woman from Brooklyn, ran
              for president in 1972. A presidential outsider because of her race
              and gender, Chisholm faced steep odds. However, Chisholm’s
              candidacy also galvanized communities of color, young people, and
              urban voters who felt marginalized by politics as usual. This
              photograph captures Shirley Chisholm supporters holding signs and
              Chisholm’s trademark poster in the audience at the 1972 Democratic
              National Convention. Courtesy of University of North Carolina at

            <span
              >In 2016, a billionaire businessman and the first woman nominated
              by a major party ran against each other for president of the
              United States. In very different ways, both candidates approached
              the presidency as outsiders, reaching beyond the traditional
              boundaries of US presidential politics. As outsiders, the 2016
              candidates are noteworthy, but not unique; indeed, the 2016 race
              resonates with the legacies of outsiders who have come before.
              This exhibition explores the rich history of select individuals,
              parties, events, and movements that have influenced US
              presidential elections from the outside—outside Washington
              politics, outside the two-party system, and outside the
              traditional conception of who can be an American president.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Outsider, in this context, requires a dynamic definition. Featured
            stories explore candidates who defined themselves as Washington
            outsiders, such as World War II general Dwight Eisenhower, yet also
            those who were labeled or treated as outsiders because of their
            race, gender, or beliefs. In 1964, Republican Senator Margaret Chase
            Smith was the first woman to run for a major party’s presidential
            nomination. Twenty years later, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson
            built the Rainbow Coalition to unite marginalized and minority
            groups who felt excluded from politics and ran the most successful
            campaign by an African American candidate up to that point.
            Reformers whose principles are not represented by major party
            platforms have found a voice through third-party campaigns, such as
            that of the anti-slavery Liberty Party of the mid-nineteenth
            century. Still others have defined presidential candidacies in
            opposition to perceived outsiders, such as the anti-immigrant Know
            Nothing Party of the 1850s and the segregationist Dixiecrats in
            1948.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span
              >These stories share common themes: determination to change the
              system, put pressure on major parties and force them to adapt, and
              give voice to new ideas though America’s presidential election
              process. These forces of change are not always positive; the
              stories represented here illuminate both the best and worst about
              America — both its capacity for and resistance to change in the
              face of its most reactionary and most idealistic impulses.
              Somewhere in between fall the stories of outsiders strategically
              navigating a political moment, forging their own political
              careers, and advancing their own political agendas.</span

                This hand-drawn, hand-colored illustration depicts Andrew
                Jackson in military uniform emerging from a cloud. Dated 1827,
                this image was created as Jackson prepared for the 1828
                presidential election, in which his supporters promoted his
                record as a military hero. Courtesy of Free Library of

                office in roles such as state governor, Congressional
                representative, or vice president prior to becoming president.
                The number of years of service varies widely—Woodrow Wilson was
                governor of New Jersey for only a year before running for the
                presidency, while Lyndon Johnson brought twenty-four years of
                congressional experience to the White House. The most common
                profession for presidents is lawyer, but there are outliers here
                too: Ronald Reagan was an actor and Herbert Hoover was a mining
                engineer.</span

                &nbsp;A common profile of the successful non-politician outsider
                in presidential elections has been the military hero, called to
                lead the American people after victory on the battlefield.
                &nbsp;In the nineteenth century, Presidents Andrew Jackson and
                Zachary Taylor each sought an electoral victory on the basis, in
                whole or in part, of their military leadership. In the twentieth
                century, President Dwight Eisenhower followed a similar formula
                to win the presidency following World War II.</span

                This broadside reflects the influence of the anti-slavery
                movement and its stronghold in Massachusetts, which was home to
                William Lloyd Garrison and the American Anti-Slavery Society, as
                well as prominent members of the Liberty Party. In a number of
                mid nineteenth-century elections, including 1840 and 1844, the
                future of slavery in the United States was a core issue for
                voters and politicians. Anti-slavery sentiment galvanized modest
                support for reformers like the Liberty Party. Courtesy of Boston

              Third-party candidates in US presidential elections have
              historically presented challenges to America’s two-party system,
              which has been particularly fixed as Democrat and Republican since
              the mid-nineteenth century. Falling all along the political
              spectrum, from conservative to moderate to liberal to radical,
              third parties and their nominees play an important role by
              offering voters reform alternatives to more established party
              politics and sometimes by campaigning on a single issue platform.
              Although they often struggle to compete with mainstream parties
              because of their relative lack of financial resources, third party
              candidates keep the possibility of reform in the minds of American
              voters and push more mainstream candidates to clarify and shift
              their political views.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third-party presidential runs have met with mixed results.
              Socialist Eugene V. Debs ran five times for president on a
              workers’ rights platform, receiving 6% of the popular vote in
              1912, his most successful election. 1924 Progressive Party nominee
              Robert La Follette, running on a broad progressive ticket, won 16%
              of the popular vote and 13 electoral votes from his home state of
              Wisconsin. Former Alabama governor George Wallace ran for
              president three times on a states’ rights platform, winning five
              southern states and 46 electoral votes in 1968. But a few
              third-party outsiders have had a profound impact inside the
              traditional two-party system—by shifting votes away from major
              parties and influencing the outcome of the election, or by
              achieving a degree of popular vote that threatened or beat that of
              a major party candidate. This section explores these third-party
              reform stories.

                to be nominated by a major party for president of the United
                States. Also a candidate in the 2008 primary race for the
                Democratic nomination, Clinton’s career in presidential politics
                builds on an over 140-year legacy of women who have run for the
                nation’s highest office in a system that, until now, has by law
                and custom kept women outside the oval office.</span

                decades before the ratification of the Constitution’s nineteenth
                amendment granted women the right to vote. Concurrent with the
                work of women’s rights activists and suffragists, each of their
                candidacies represented a radical forward-thinking
                interpretation of women’s rights to citizenship and political
                participation that would take a generation for the American
                government to recognize.</span

                presidential nominations by major parties. Though unsuccessful
                in seeking the nomination, each showed that a woman can and
                should be taken seriously as a legitimate contender for the US
                presidency, paving the way for Hillary Clinton’s historic 2008
                primary campaign and 2016 nomination.</span

                >While many outsider candidates have changed and diversified the
                face of the American presidency, other political platforms
                formed to resist perceived outsiders and their influence on
                American politics. These anti-outsider platforms play to
                xenophobic and racist fears of disenfranchised and
                underrepresented “others” in the US political landscape—like
                immigrants and African Americans—and the potential changes to
                the social order that they might bring when politically
                empowered. Fears include imagined threats of crime and
                intermarriage that challenged native-born white entitlement to
                public spaces like schools and neighborhoods and economic
                opportunities like jobs. These platforms promise renewed
                policing of social and legal boundaries that maintain the status
                quo. Although they have historically not been successful at
                achieving the presidency, anti-outsider platforms shed light on
                the priorities of the significant numbers of voters who support
                them in the context of historical climates of
                discrimination.</span

            <p>
              Early anti-outsider platforms in the nineteenth century included
              resistance to immigration and naturalization from the Know Nothing
              Party and post-Reconstruction rejection of black enfranchisement
              from southern Democrats. By the mid-twentieth century,
              anti-outsider platforms like that of the Dixiecrats opposed
              federal intervention into civil rights issues, the integration of
              schools and the armed forces, and the empowerment of black voters
              through anti-discrimination voting laws. More recently, these
              campaigns take stands against undocumented immigration from Mexico
              while playing on similar fears about jobs and crime as their
              predecessors.

                In this 1967 press conference clip, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
                predicts what it would take, in his opinion, for the United
                States to elect a black president. The question, for King, was
                never of capability or qualification. Instead it would be a
                matter of consolidating black voting power, coalition-building,
                and unity with white liberal voters. Courtesy of WSB-TV, Walter

                >African Americans have been active political organizers
                throughout the nation’s history—petitioning, organizing, voting,
                protesting, and serving their communities from the era of early
                republic through the Abolition Movement, Reconstruction, and the
                era of lynching and segregation. By the mid-twentieth century,
                as the number of African American voters grew rapidly through
                both legislative action and political empowerment, presidential
                candidates were required to court their votes by appealing to
                their concerns. This growing constituency also made it possible
                for black candidates to run for office with more success, which
                legitimized the idea that black candidates were contenders for
                the presidency for an increasingly broad and interracial group
                of voters.</span

                  >In 1964, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party brought
                  national attention the issue of black voter disenfranchisement
                  in Mississippi and demanded that the Democratic Party confront
                  the reality of injustice. Eight years later, as Shirley
                  Chisholm ran for president, members of the National Black
                  Political Convention met to strategize about how to build on
                  the legal gains of the Civil Rights Movement and continue to
                  work towards expanded political power for African Americans.
                  In 1984 and 1988, Jesse Jackson ran for the Democratic Party’s
                  presidential nomination and earned support from a broader, and
                  more diverse group of Americans than had previously supported
                  a black presidential candidate, laying the groundwork for the
                  successful candidacy of Barack Obama, who was elected as the
                  first black president, in 2008.</span

                This voting record of the electoral college in the presidential
                election of 1824 shows that Andrew Jackson earned more votes
                than each of his opponents, but not a majority of the 261 total
                votes. The House of Representatives was empowered to elect the
                president in such circumstances and, rather than endorse
                Jackson’s win, they voted in favor of John Quincy Adams. Jackson
                perceived this as evidence of elitist corruption. Courtesy of
                National Archives and Records Administration.

            <p>
              Andrew Jackson had some insider credentials when he first ran for
              president in 1824; he had briefly served in Congress and as
              territorial governor. However, Jackson defined his candidacy not
              on his political experience but on his outsider status—a “man of
              the people” who proved his presidential qualifications on the
              battlefield, not the ballot, and who appealed to new white male
              voters, many recently enfranchised as states lifted property
              qualifications for suffrage rights during the early 1800s. Despite
              Jackson’s “common man” appeal, he was in fact a wealthy landowner
              whose fortune was wholly dependent on the labor of hundreds of
              enslaved men, women, and children.
            </p>
            <p>
              The election of 1824 was a turning point in the evolution of the
              two-party system. Four candidates, each largely bolstered by
              geographically sectional support, all ran for the same Democratic
              Republican party. Andrew Jackson won more votes than his opponents
              but, since Jackson failed to win a majority of votes, the power to
              elect the president went to the House of Representatives. There,
              Jackson was defeated by the alleged insider political alliance of
              his opponents, Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. House Speaker
              Henry Clay supported second place finisher John Quincy Adams, who
              won the presidency.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1824 defeat heavily shaped Jackson’s 1828 campaign. Jackson’s
              supporters doubled down on his image as military hero and favorite
              of the American people, while his opponents used his violent
              military record against him. In 1828, Jackson’s victory was
              decisive, ushering in the era of Jacksonian Democracy, which
              redefined the role of the “common” (white) man in American
              politics.

                Zachary Taylor was lionized by Americans of all political
                stripes after his success as a general in the Mexican-American
                War. This hat, adorned with a portrait of Taylor, was worn by a
                member of the Taylor Hose Company, a volunteer fire company in
                Philadelphia that had named itself in honor of the hero general.
                It was this celebrity-like status that led the Whig Party to
                court Taylor as their presidential candidate. Courtesy of
                National Museum of American History, Kenneth E. Behring Center,

              <span
                >In the election of 1848, the Whig Party, which had emerged in
                the 1830s in opposition to the Democratic Party, turned to a
                politically inexperienced military hero as their candidate for
                president. Zachary Taylor, like Jackson, served in the War of
                1812 and Seminole War, but had risen to national hero status as
                General "Old Rough and Ready" during the Mexican-American War
                (1845-1847). &nbsp;</span

            </p>
            <p>
              <span
                >Taylor, a slaveowner, had no political affiliation prior to his
                candidacy for president and, on some issues, blatantly
                conflicted with established Whig principles like their adamant
                anti-Mexican War stance and opposition to the expansion of
                slavery. The Whigs gambled that Taylor’s celebrity and broad
                public appeal would outweigh his lack of strong political
                conviction and help them compete against the Democratic party’s
                Lewis Cass and Martin Van Buren of the Free Soil Party.
                Ultimately, the Whigs won that bet, but lost party unity in the
                long run. &nbsp;</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Taylor won the election by a small margin but, in the process,
              sharply divided the Whig Party between those who seized the
              opportunity for a celebrity candidate and those who remained true
              to political principle. The Whig Party never again succeeded in
              electing a candidate to the presidency and in the succeeding years
              dissolved amidst internal tensions over slavery. Over the
              following decade, the Republican Party emerged, replacing the
              Whigs as the second major party in opposition to the Democrats.
              The 1848 win was even less gratifying when Taylor died after less
              than a year and a half in office.

                Dwight Eisenhower became a household name as a general during
                World War II, leading operations in North Africa and Europe. In
                posters like this one, the US Army used Eisenhower's likeness to
                generate support for the war effort on the home front. Courtesy

                >Dwight Eisenhower won the election of 1952 in a landslide and
                became a widely celebrated president who led the country during
                an era of economic prosperity. &nbsp;Prior to his presidential
                candidacy, however, Eisenhower was a political outsider; he had
                no public party affiliation and had never even voted.

                famous for his service as a five-star general and commander of
                the Allied forces in Europe during World War II. In 1948,
                Eisenhower was courted as a candidate by both the Democratic and
                Republican parties, but declined to run. In 1952, however, he
                declared that he was a Republican and agreed to run for
                president on a platform of opposition to communism, the Korean
                War, and corruption.</span

                and was still serving as a NATO commander in Europe during the
                first several months of his candidacy. He returned to campaign
                during the summer of 1952 and, already a household name,
                Eisenhower’s heroic, yet down-to-earth demeanor and catchy “I
                like Ike” slogan propelled him to victory.</span

                    Liberty Party founder James Birney articulates his party’s
                    opposition to the anti-political, anti-Constitution stance
                    of William Lloyd Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery Society.
                    The Liberty Party, by contrast, believed that the abolition
                    of slavery should be achieved within the political system
                    and that the Constitution supported this cause. Birney would
                    become the Liberty Party’s presidential nominee in both 1840
                    and 1844. Courtesy of New York Public Library via

            <p>
              The Liberty Party was formed in 1839 in upstate New York in
              response to political fractures within the American abolitionist
              movement, particularly around the interpretation of the US
              Constitution. The American Anti-Slavery Society, run by
              abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, denounced the Constitution as
              a "covenant with death and an agreement with hell," and advocated
              that abolitionists divorce themselves from its authority and
              mainstream politics in general to achieve reform. In contrast,
              founders of the Liberty Party interpreted the Constitution as an
              anti-slavery document, and hoped to use traditional political
              avenues such as elected office to accomplish anti-slavery reform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Liberty Party founder James Birney was a Kentucky-born lawyer,
              former slaveholder, and celebrated convert to the abolitionist
              cause. The Liberty Party nominated Birney as their presidential
              candidate in 1840, although he only received 6,797 votes. Birney
              was once again nominated as the party’s candidate for 1844. This
              time, due to concerns over the annexation of Texas and its
              implications for slavery and politics, the Liberty Party received
              more popular support from voters who found the Whig Party
              candidate Henry Clay too compromising on the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the election, Birney won 62,103 votes or 2.3% of the popular
              vote, with 15,800 votes coming from voters in New York. Many
              speculated that the Liberty Party’s success in New York ironically
              helped throw a presidential victory from Clay to James Polk, the
              pro-slavery Democratic candidate. With New York, Clay would have
              had the majority of electoral votes.

                This campaign flyer for the Progressive Party for the 1912
                Theodore Roosevelt-Hiram Johnson ticket outlines the Progressive
                political platform and its reform ideas. Hiram Johnson, the
                Progressive Party candidate for Vice President, was the leader
                of the progressive element of California’s Republican party. The
                flyer’s reference to Abraham Lincoln reflects the challenges the
                Progressive Party would pose to the Republican Party in the
                election. Courtesy of Duke University Libraries via North

            <p>
              After seven years as US president from 1901 to 1908, Republican
              Theodore Roosevelt decided to re-enter the race for the presidency
              in 1912 to challenge his successor, William Taft. When he failed
              to secure the Republican nomination, Roosevelt formed the
              Progressive or “Bull Moose” Party and ran for president on its
              ticket. The Progressive Party advocated a broad reform platform,
              including farm relief, social insurance, limits on campaign
              contributions, and an eight-hour workday. In 1912, Roosevelt also
              became the first presidential candidate to formally endorse
              women’s suffrage and advocate for women’s participation in
              Progressive Party organizing. By the 1912 election, women had
              equal suffrage to men in six states and constituted 1.3 million
              voters. Through both organizing and voting, they formed an
              important part of the Progressive Party’s success in the 1912
              election.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the election, Roosevelt and the Progressives challenged
              the success of Republican incumbent William Taft’s campaign, and
              created a race in which Roosevelt was perceived as the primary
              challenge to Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson. Despite an
              assassination attempt in October 1912, Roosevelt campaigned to the
              end. Wilson won the election, while Taft achieved only 23% of the
              popular vote and eight electoral votes. Roosevelt earned 27% of
              the popular vote and eighty-eight electoral votes (including
              states like California and Washington that had passed women’s
              suffrage legislation), making him the most successful third-party
              candidate in US history.

                This 1993 video footage from the KXAS-TV/NBC station in Fort
                Worth, Texas, documents Ross Perot's campaign and membership
                drive for his organization, United We Stand America, which
                monitored the voting records of elected officials. It gives a
                sense of Perot’s campaign platform and includes Perot playing
                Patsy Cline's song "Crazy," which was his official campaign song
                in 1992. Courtesy of UNT Archives via The Portal to Texas

            <p>
              After strife with the Bush administration about the Persian Gulf
              War, billionaire businessman Ross Perot decided to run as an
              independent candidate for president in 1992. Appealing to
              resentment towards established politicians and advancing himself
              as a vital third candidate option, Perot campaigned on a platform
              that included balancing the federal budget, opposition to gun
              control, the end of job outsourcing, opposition to NAFTA, and
              popular input on government through electronic direct democracy
              town hall meetings. Perot challenged his supporters to petition
              for his name to appear on the ballot in all fifty states.
            </p>
            <p>
              After primary season in June 1992, Perot briefly led the election
              in polls with 39% of the popular vote over Democrat Bill Clinton
              and incumbent Republican George H. W. Bush. But by July 1992,
              Perot’s campaign faced internal challenges and Perot formally
              withdrew from the race. Although he re-entered on October 1, 1992,
              voters remained unsure whether he was officially running and his
              popular image was dogged by his images as a “quitter.” In spite of
              this turbulence, Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, from voters
              spread across the country as well as across party lines. Perot ran
              again in 1996 as the Reform Party candidate and won 8% of the
              popular vote. With his challenges to mainstream politics, he
              emerged as one of the most successful third party candidates in US
              history, with the most support from across the political spectrum
              since Theodore Roosevelt.

                    married at age fifteen, divorced her first husband at
                    twenty-six, and moved to New York City with her sister
                    Tennessee in 1868. &nbsp;This carte de visite shows a
                    portrait of Victoria Woodhull. Carte de visites were
                    commonly distributed or sold in the late nineteenth century
                    as collectors’ items or to raise awareness for a cause.

                became a businesswoman who founded a Wall Street stock
                brokerage, the founder and editor of her own newspaper, a free
                love advocate who spoke out against the societal limitations of
                marriage, and the first woman to be nominated for president.

                party was a radical offshoot of the National Woman Suffrage
                Association and sought to build support among former
                abolitionists, black suffragists, and white women’s rights
                activists. Frederick Douglass was chosen as Woodhull’s running
                mate, but he never acknowledged or accepted the nomination. In
                her campaign speeches, Woodhull argued that, as citizens, women
                already had the right to vote and hold office as a result of the
                fourteenth and fifteenth amendments—they just needed to use

                Woodhull was a controversial figure, even in women’s rights

                her role in exposing the sex scandal of popular minister Henry
                Ward Beecher. While she did receive some popular votes, it is
                unknown how many as no ballots listing her name survive.</span

                >Belva Ann Lockwood followed Victoria Woodhull as the
                presidential nominee of the Equal Rights Party in the 1884 and
                1888 elections. Like Woodhull, Lockwood was a suffragist and
                accomplished professional; she was an educator, a lawyer with
                her own practice in Washington, DC, and the first woman admitted
                to practice before the Supreme Court. &nbsp;As the 1884 election
                approached, Lockwood expressed frustration with the National
                Woman Suffrage Association leadership’s support for the
                Republican Party, writing that she did not "see any advantage of
                standing by the party that does not stand by us."</span

              <span
                >Inspired by Lockwood’s political independence and commitment to
                action, the reform-minded Equal Rights Party selected Lockwood
                as their nominee and she accepted. Lockwood campaigned at
                rallies around the country on a platform that addressed a broad
                range of policy issues and included political equality on the
                basis of race and sex as a central tenet. Lockwood argued that
                although she could not vote, as an American-born citizen over
                the age of thirty-five, there was nothing in the Constitution
                that suggested she could not be voted for or could not hold
                office. Lockwood’s running mate was California suffragist
                Marietta Stow.</span

                >Lockwood received over 4,700 votes in eight states, though she
                contended that her votes were not counted fairly in some places.
                Lockwood ran again with less success in 1888 and, after that,
                continued to advocate for the causes of women's suffrage and
                international peace. After a career spanning four decades, she
                died in 1917 at age eighty-six, still without the right to
                vote.</span

                Senator Kenneth Keating was a Republican from New York who
                hosted <em>Senator Keating Reports</em>, a series of televised
                talk show style interviews with fellow political figures and
                government officials to bring viewers “an inside view of
                Washington.” In this April 1964 episode, Keating speaks with
                Senator and presidential candidate Margaret Chase Smith.

                >In 1964, Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine
                became the first woman to run for a major party’s presidential
                nomination. Smith began her national political career in 1940,
                when she won the Congressional seat previously held by her
                husband. She served in the House of Representatives and Senate
                for the next thirty-three years and was the first woman to serve
                in both houses of Congress.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >In January 1964, Smith announced that she would be a candidate
                in the New Hampshire and Illinois Republican primaries. In her
                announcement speech, she listed the reasons that others had
                levied as to why she should </span
              ><span>not </span
              ><span
                >run: that the White House was a man’s world; the odds against
                her were too steep; she did not have the physical stamina to run
                a campaign; and that she did not have the financial or political
                backing to succeed. &nbsp;</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Yet, Smith also detailed the reasons that she should run,
                including having more political experience than other
                candidates. Smith also argued that, whatever happened, she had
                the “</span
              ><span
                >oppor­tunity to break the barrier against women being
                serious­ly considered for the Presi­dency.” Smith received
                little support from the Republican establishment, but was
                considered by many</span

                >to be a serious, highly qualified candidate. In a November 1963
                press conference, shortly before leaving for Dallas, Texas,
                President John F. Kennedy said of Smith’s candidacy, "She is a
                very formidable political figure."</span

                though she did not win any states, earned the support of
                twenty-five convention delegates and became the first woman to

                    >In her presidential campaign announcement, Shirley Chisholm
                    refused to accept the norms of party politics and predicted
                    a new political future. She said, “I am not the candidate of
                    any political bosses or fat cats or special interests. I am
                    the candidate of the people of America. And my presence
                    before you now symbolizes a new era in American political
                    history.” This photograph shows Chisholm at the 1972
                    Democratic National Convention, where she received 152
                    delegate votes, approximately ten percent of the total.

                >Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman elected
                to Congress and a founding member of both the Congressional
                Black Caucus and National Women’s Political Caucus. As a
                congresswoman representing Brooklyn, New York, Chisholm
                advocated for programs such as Head Start, food stamps, and
                education. In 1972, one hundred years after Victoria Woodhull’s
                run, Shirley Chisholm became the first African American person
                to run for president and the second woman, following Smith, to
                seek a major party’s presidential nomination.</span

                >Shirley Chisholm announced her candidacy for the Democratic
                Party nomination in January 1972 and ran on an anti-war platform
                that championed marginalized groups such as minorities, blue
                collar workers, and inner-city families and promoted social and
                economic justice for poor and urban communities. &nbsp;With her
                slogan, “Unbought and Unbossed,” Chisholm embraced her outsider
                status, rejecting the status quo of party politics that made
                financial backing and party approval political requisites.</span
              >

            <p>
              <span
                >Chisholm’s campaign received pushback from multiple angles,
                including among some African Americans who resented her gender
                and feminists who hesitated to endorse her because they did not
                think she would succeed. However, Chisholm campaigned throughout
                the primaries, winning votes in fourteen states, and earning 152
                pledged delegates going into the Democratic convention. Chisholm
                was the most successful female presidential candidate to date
                but, like Smith, she looked ahead to others that would follow
                down the path she had helped to forge. She wrote, “The next time
                a woman runs, or a black, or a Jew or anyone from a group that
                the country is ‘not ready’ to elect to its highest office, I
                believe that he or she will be taken seriously from the start.”

              Formed in the early 1840s and popular through the 1850s, the Know
              Nothing movement was a reaction to the influx of German and Irish
              immigrants to the United States. Proponents saw these newcomers as
              a “foreign invasion” that threatened to influence politics and
              religion. They advocated to curb immigration and naturalization
              and played on white native-born fears about outsiders. More
              extreme members of the movement claimed that new Catholic
              immigrants would help subjugate America under the authority of the
              Pope. The movement organized in various social clubs and political
              forums across the country and created propaganda to draw adherents
              to their cause.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Know Nothing Party, otherwise known as the American Party and
              the Native American Party, functioned as the political arm of the
              movement. By 1856, it had gained enough momentum to launch a bid
              for the presidency on a singularly focused platform—shutting down
              immigration to the United States and containing and marginalizing
              Catholicism. Former president Millard Fillmore ran as their
              candidate for a non-consecutive second term. Although not
              previously a nativist, he saw the Know Nothings as the only viable
              option for national unity in the face of the dissolution of the
              Whig Party and the ongoing struggle between other parties on the
              issue of slavery. Fillmore won only eight electoral votes but
              achieved 21% of the popular vote. Many 1856 Know Nothing adherents
              also voted in support of the fledgling Republican Party, which had
              started to court this demographic by campaigning around
              anti-Popery and bans on immigration.

            <p>
              In the summer of 1948, conservative white southern Democrats
              formed the States’ Rights Democratic Party, also known as the
              Dixiecrats, in reaction to President Harry Truman’s support of the
              civil rights plank in the national Democratic Party platform and
              his executive order to desegregate the armed forces. The
              Dixiecrats supported a segregationist agenda that rejected federal
              intervention and racial integration and advocated for the
              preservation of Jim Crow laws and white supremacy. Where rhetoric
              within the Dixiecrat campaign often focused on the federal
              government as the outsider threatening to take away power from
              states, this talk was a surrogate for fear of the political and
              social power that African Americans would achieve through activism
              and civil rights legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Dixiecrats held their one and only convention in Birmingham,
              Alabama in July 1948 and nominated South Carolina Senator Strom
              Thurmond as their candidate for president. Their goal was to win
              127 electoral votes in the election, denying both the Democrats
              and Republicans a majority and forcing the decision into the House
              of Representatives where they could negotiate the civil rights
              agenda. In November 1948, Thurmond received 2.4% of the popular
              vote and 39 electoral votes, carrying Alabama, Louisiana, South
              Carolina, and Mississippi. Significantly, this support came
              overwhelmingly from states with disenfranchised black majority
              populations, where white voters felt most threatened by the
              dissolution of segregation and the political possibilities of
              black enfranchisement. The Dixiecrats dissolved after the 1948
              election but their political work began the weakening of the
              formerly all-Democratic “Solid South.”

            <p>
              Alabama governor George Wallace rose to national prominence in
              1963 for his strong stance against the integration of public
              schools in Alabama. In his inaugural speech for his first term as
              governor in January 1963, Wallace famously advocated for
              “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.”
              Television viewers around the world saw Wallace’s “Stand in the
              Schoolhouse Door” later that year, in which he would attempt to
              halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James Hood
              at the University of Alabama. Wallace sought the Democratic
              nomination for president in 1964, 1972, and 1976, but ran as a
              third-party candidate for the American Independent Party in 1968
              with the most success.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1968, Wallace ran on a platform similar to that of the
              Dixiecrats twenty years earlier that rejected the outside
              intervention of the federal government on civil rights issues like
              education while also capitalizing on reactive white fear and
              racism stirred up by recent civil rights gains like the Voting
              Rights Act, school integration, and anti-discrimination laws. In
              his campaign, Wallace appealed to white working and middle-class
              voters who feared for the safety of their jobs, neighborhoods, and
              schools, by positioning the oppressed and overlooked “redneck” as
              the new outsider displaced by federal law and black activism. In
              the general election, Wallace won five states—Georgia,
              Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas—and their 46
              electoral votes. More surprisingly, he won 13.5 % of the popular
              vote or almost 10 million votes that reflected widespread support
              from across the country.

                At this spring 1964 press conference, Robert Moses of the
                Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) explains the
                agenda for the upcoming Freedom Summer initiative. Freedom
                Summer organizers invited college students—many of them white—to
                Mississippi to lead Freedom Schools and help register voters
                during the summer of 1964. Their objective, also reflected by
                the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, was to secure black
                voting power going into the 1964 presidential election and to
                get the country to “actually take a look at Mississippi.”

                >Founded in April of 1964, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
                Party (MFDP) challenged the authority of the all-white
                Democratic Party that dominated Mississippi politics and
                disenfranchised black voters. &nbsp;Bolstered by Freedom Summer
                voter registration efforts in black communities throughout the
                state and alternative “Freedom Ballots” organized in parallel
                with official elections, MFDP hosted its own state convention
                and elected its own delegation to the 1964 Democratic National
                Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</span

                endured brutal physical abuse in retribution for her efforts to
                vote freely. Her televised testimony at the Democratic
                convention’s credentials hearing convinced many Americans that
                the MFDP delegates should be recognized. However, when
                threatened with a walkout by other white southern delegations,
                President Lyndon Johnson and other party leaders refused to
                unseat the Mississippi delegation in favor of the MFDP. Instead,
                they offered a weak compromise to the MFDP: two at-large
                non-voting seats. The MFDP refused these terms.

              The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party’s presence at the
              convention drew national attention to the brutality of black voter
              disenfranchisement in Mississippi and throughout the South and
              helped catalyze support for the Voting Rights Act, which was
              passed the following year. Their dismissal by the Democratic Party
              reinforced the importance of their work; expanding black voting
              rights and political power would be critical in order to ensure
              representation in institutions of political power like party
              conventions and elected office.

                This newsclipping features a few of the leaders of the Gary
                convention: Rev. Walter Fauntroy (top left) was a Washington DC
                minister who had worked with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and a
                congressman; Mayor Richard Hatcher was the first African
                American mayor of Gary, Indiana, and convention co-chairman;
                Rev. Jesse Jackson led the civil rights organization Operation
                PUSH, and Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King,
                continued to be a champion of civil rights throughout her
                career. Rev. Jesse Jackson later reflected, on the importance of
                the convention: “Getting the right to vote in '65 was the
                beginning of a process, but the convention in Gary solidified
                the sense of focus. It was overwhelming.” Courtesy of Frank Mt.

              <span
                >The early 1970s was a turning point moment in which black
                political leaders sought to employ the legal gains of the Civil
                Rights Movement and Black Power ideology towards a new era of
                black political empowerment at local, state, and federal levels.
                In 1972, as Shirley Chisholm ran for the Democratic Party
                nomination, the National Black Political Convention met in Gary,
                Indiana, bringing together thousands of delegates from black
                communities and organizations across the country to foster unity
                and determine a black political agenda by which current and
                future candidates for office would be assessed.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >While both the convention and Chisholm’s candidacy represent
                landmark events, they were not necessarily politically
                coordinated. Chisholm was proud of her black identity, but she
                rejected the idea that she was the candidate solely representing
                the interests of black America. The convention, led by some of
                her colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, did not
                endorse her. Some felt that Chisholm had run without consulting
                established black leadership and believed the first African
                American presidential candidate should have been a man. Many
                black leaders and officeholders endorsed George McGovern, though
                Chisholm’s platform most clearly aligned with the national black
                political agenda the convention had put forth.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >While the alliance of various organizations that had made the
                National Black Political Convention possible dissolved amidst
                differing philosophies, the Gary convention had tangible
                results. The late 1970s and 1980s witnessed a rapid expansion of
                African American elected officials at the local, state, and
                congressional levels, including Shirley Chisholm’s reelection as
                Congresswoman, an office she held until 1983.</span

                Jesse Jackson’s campaign was built on a foundation of grassroots
                organizing—reaching marginalized communities in their
                neighborhoods, churches, and other institutions. An ordained
                Baptist minister, Jesse Jackson’s campaign speeches often had a
                sermon-like quality. In this photograph, Jackson speaks to the
                congregation at McKinley Avenue Baptist Church in Los Angeles,
                California. Courtesy of UCLA, Library Special Collections,

                >Rev. Jesse Jackson began his public career as a civil rights
                organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In late 1983,
                with decades of organizing experience but no experience in
                elected office, Jesse Jackson declared his candidacy for the
                Democratic Party’s 1984 presidential nomination. Jackson
                leveraged the black political mobilization of the 1970s and
                expanded its inclusivity, appealing to the concerns and
                interests of a “Rainbow Coalition” of marginalized and minority
                citizens, including African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans,
                women, gay people, poor people, and more. &nbsp;</span

                >The Democratic Party of the early 1980s had relied on the votes
                of these marginalized communities, but in the view of many, fell
                short of making a real effort to represent them. Amidst the
                Reagan Revolution, which reduced government support for social
                and education programs and civil rights initiatives, Jesse
                Jackson led a grassroots campaign paired with efforts in voter
                registration. In doing so, he built his voter base as he went,
                diversified the Democratic Party, and offered a political vision
                inspired by the activism of the Civil Rights era and the legacy
                of the New Deal. Jackson did not win the nomination, but
                surprised many by winning five primary contests and finishing
                with 3.2 million votes.</span

                  >In the 1988 campaign, Jesse Jackson was even more successful,
                  winning more primaries and earning broader support across both
                  white and minority voters. Jackson also commanded greater
                  recognition and respect from the party. Though Jackson did not
                  win the nomination, twenty-three year old future president
                  Barack Obama and millions of Americans watched Jackson prove
                  that an African American could be broadly accepted as a
                  legitimate candidate for president.</span

                American mother, began his 2008 presidential campaign as a
                relative newcomer to Washington politics. He was the first term
                junior senator from Illinois who ran for the Democratic Party’s
                nomination in part on his status as a party outsider, espousing
                a fresh vision of hope and change, a counterargument to
                Washington politics as usual. Obama would become the first
                African American president of the United States.</span

                who commanded strong support in many black communities and among
                black political leaders. However, the primaries proved that
                Obama’s message resonated and that he could earn votes across
                the country, from overwhelmingly white Iowa to South Carolina,
                where he garnered support from the majority African American
                voter base. Barack Obama went on to win the presidential
                election with 69.5 million votes, the most ever cast for a
                presidential candidate to date.</span

                Political Convention, and countless others that came before him.
                However, in critical ways, Obama represented a shift; he had not
                been a part of the Civil Rights Movement or Black Power-era
                political organizing. Instead, he was part of the generation
                that was heir to the political landscape that these movements
                helped create—where people were registered and could vote
                regardless of race, class, or creed and where an African
