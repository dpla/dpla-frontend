            The stock market crash on October 29, 1929 -- known as Black Tuesday
            -- was the "worst economic collapse in the history of the modern
            industrial world." It spread from the United States to national
            economies across the globe. It ended a decade known for its
            high-spirited free-spending, called the Roaring 20s, and began
            almost 10 years of financial desperation that would touch nearly
            every citizen of the United States. The Great Depression caused bank
            closures and business failures and by its end, saw "more than 15
            million Americans (one-quarter of the workforce)" unemployed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herbert Hoover, president at the time, did not acknowledge the depth
            of the crisis and assumed that the American characteristics of
            individualism and self reliance would quickly bring the nation out
            of the disaster without a need for federal intervention. But,
            layoffs and financial desperation at the personal level were
            growing: "an empty pocket turned inside out was called a 'Hoover
            flag' [and] the decrepit shanty towns springing up around the
            country were called 'Hoovervilles'."
          </p>
          <p>
            Three years into the financial crisis, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
            running on a platform of federal recovery programs called the "New
            Deal," easily took the presidential election of 1932.

              The six months leading up to the stock market crash gave some
              indication of the financial crisis ahead. The economy had already
              begun to slump, but no one could forecast the dramatic crash
              experienced on that October day in 1929. The three years following
              saw continued decreases in stock prices until, in "late 1932, they
              had dropped to only about 20 percent of their value in 1929." By
              1933, nearly half of America's banks had failed, causing, in large
              part, a drastic reduction in US manufacturing and unemployment of
              nearly 30% of the American public.

            <p>
              Franklin Roosevelt was&nbsp;born in privilege and wealth on a
              family estate at Hyde Park, New York.&nbsp;His comfortable
              upbringing meant that he did not relate directly to the struggles
              of the underclasses. His father oversaw mining and transportation
              interests. Roosevelt entered politics early, taking on the Tammany
              Democrats in New York and ultimately putting a dent in this
              powerful political machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not always successful in politics, Roosevelt partnered with Louis
              Howe to save his career. A New York journalist, Howe would play an
              important role in rebuilding Roosevelt's political career that
              would ultimately send him to the oval office. Roosevelt's ability
              to campaign was limited by an early bout with polio that would dog
              his health throughout his life. So, Howe and Roosevelt focused on
              getting the word out through print to his mostly rural
              constituency. Newspaper advertisements highlighted "FDR's support
              of better prices for farm products, a rollback in license fees for
              fishermen, and the standardization of apple barrel sizes, which
              would prevent apple growers from being cheated by buyers."
            </p>
            <p>
              Howe also helped Roosevelt's brilliant but introverted wife,
              Eleanor, morph into an effective politician in her own right. Her
              &nbsp;"transformation [would later keep] her husband's career
              alive while FDR struggled with polio."

              The New Deal programs were known as the three "Rs"; Roosevelt
              believed that together Relief, Reform, and Recovery could bring
              economic stability to the nation. Reform programs focused
              specifically on methods for ensuring that depressions like that in
              the 1930s would never affect the American public again. These
              programs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission,
              Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Social Security
              Administration tended to focus on the management of money from the
              stock market and banking sector to the individual citizen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Relief programs, on which this section focuses, were
              implemented to immediately stop the continued economic freefall.
              These included the Emergency Banking Act, which ensured that only
              solvent banks remained open, and bank holidays that would close
              financial institutions when a wave of financial panic occurred. In
              addition, the Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA), the Civil Works
              Administration (CWA), and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
              provided immediate support in the form of cash payments and
              temporary employment. And, in doing so, helped to develop and
              repair the American transportation infrastructure, and literally
              construct the foundations of National Parks across the US.

                by creating long-term employment opportunities, decreasing
                agricultural supply to drive prices up, and helping homeowners
                pay mortgages and stay in their homes, which also kept the banks

                pieces of legislation establishing New Deal agencies and
                programs. Among the Recovery programs were the National
                Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which </span

                and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The NRA was one
                of the most controversial of the New Deal programs because it
                required government-based industrial regulation. Some of the
                rules, viewed as pro-union, included </span

                programs. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided work
                for a variety of professionals including nurses, librarians,
                artists, and craftsmen. And, the Tennessee Valley Authority
                (TVA) would provide employment and hydroelectric power to areas

              Providing temporary employment through relief and recovery
              programs was a pivotal element of the New Deal. During the 1930’s,
              the Civil Works Administration (CWA), Work Projects Administration
              (WPA), and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) employed millions of
              people. Citizens were employed in all sorts of different work
              projects, from manual labor such as building roads and bridges, to
              artistic projects like painting public murals and putting on local
              theater. Although not enough to put an end to unemployment, these
              programs went a long way in keeping millions of Americans off the
              streets.

              FDR’s 3 Rs -- Relief, Reform, and Recovery -- aimed not only to
              alleviate the hardships of the Depression at the time he
              implemented them, but also to safeguard against any recurring
              financial disasters at the scale of the Great Depression: to make
              America a better, safer place for its citizens. The programs FDR
              implemented, therefore, had long-lasting effects on America’s
              social, cultural, infrastructural, and economic landscapes. The
              legacy of the New Deal comprised both an escape from the harsh
              economic realities of Great Depression and a gradual shift in the
              structure of government agencies and national projects, the legacy
              of which still endures today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the changes prompted by the New Deal, those with the most
              notable lingering effects are those for which we can still see
              physical evidence: utilities, transportation, and national parks.
              Projects overseen by the Works Progress Administration, the Rural
              Electrification Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority,
              and the Civilian Conservation Corps contributed to the large-scale
              reemployment efforts of the New Deal, yet the work their employees
              performed remains integral to the American landscape as we know it
              today.

              Unemployment, lack of access to bank funds, and a general collapse
              of world trade, meant many went hungry and homeless throughout the
              nation. Later, an environmental catastrophe known as the "Dust
              Bowl," affected thousands in the middle West of the United States,
              causing migrations illustrated in novels like John Steinbeck's,
              <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Particularly hard hit were African Americans and other minority
              populations, whose jobs were often taken away first and given to
              their white counterparts. In 1930, nearly 50% of black Americans
              were unemployed. It was this desperation -- from banking and
              manufacturing to unemployment and destitution -- that Roosevelt's
              New Deal meant to address.

            <p>
              Franklin Delano Roosevelt rose from the ranks of the New York
              Legislature. He realized early in his career that to develop
              long-term federal support programs that countered "more than a
              century of buccaneering, laissez-faire American capitalism," the
              country would have to realize an economic downturn. He couldn't
              have imagined that the downturn would be so dramatic, although
              "F.D.R. appreciated the irony that it was the Depression that made
              it possible for him to realize those larger objectives.”
            </p>
            <p>
              It is widely considered that few of the New Deal programs had
              sustained economic impact. Although a few, including the FDIC
              (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), Securities and Exchange
              Commission (SEC), and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
              would lay the foundation for economic growth in the post-World War
              II era and beyond.

            <p>
              Prior to the 1930s, the US government had, in general, taken a
              hands-off approach to public infrastructure, corporate practices,
              and occupational safety and health. Instead, private industry was
              left to build roads and rail, oversee the working conditions of
              their employees, and self-govern economic practices. Roosevelt,
              with the help of Congress, created many "'alphabet agencies' --
              so-called because they were known by their abbreviations" – that,
              as never before, took control of the construction of public
              utility infrastructure and put into place social, economic, and
              employment safety nets, some of which remain today.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be sure, not all of the programs were successful or lasting,
              but many had immediate impacts on impoverished individuals and the
              failing banking system. The TVA created employment from Kentucky
              to North Carolina, the AAA attempted to stabilize farm prices, and
              FERA “provided funds for state welfare programs." In fact, the
              creation of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)
              restored confidence in the banks during the Great Depression and
              played a continuing role in ensuring banking stability during the
              Great Recession of the early 2000s.

            <p>
              While there were many relief programs aimed to put Americans back
              to work, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) had the unique goal
              of preserving the country’s natural resources through the
              establishment of conservation jobs. This meant that more than
              three million men between 1933 and 1942 went to work in the parks
              and forests performing tasks such as “planting trees, building
              flood barriers, fighting fires, and maintaining roads and trails.”
              One of the legacies of the CCC was that over three billion trees
              were planted in just nine years.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CCC not only showed that the federal government valued
              protecting the environment, but also that many government agencies
              could join together in the face of national struggle to create a
              stronger nation. The Department of Labor recruited young men, the
              War Department trained them, and the Department of Agriculture
              decided on and managed the specific jobs of the workers. The work
              of these young men would become the foundations of the National
              Parks.

            <p>
              When President Franklin Roosevelt needed someone to come and make
              an effective plan for relief through the Federal Emergency Relief
              Act, he knew just whom to call. During Roosevelt’s time as
              governor of New York, he had become good friends with Harry
              Hopkins.&nbsp;Hopkins had over 20 years of experience with social
              work and welfare issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Roosevelt realized that most of the federal government’s relief
              efforts had never been successful because they often got stuck in
              political wrangling. To prevent these problems, Roosevelt told

              politics.

              The three goals of the Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA) were
              (1) to be effective, (2) provide work for employable people on the
              relief rolls, and (3) to have a diverse variety of relief
              programs. FERA provided grants from the federal government to
              state governments for a variety of projects in fields such as
              agriculture, the arts, construction and education. Many people who
              were receiving relief aid were highly trained, skilled workers.
              The hope was that by providing many different types of jobs and
              salaries that were similar to workers’ previous jobs the whole
              country would benefit.

              Even with the establishment of the Federal Emergency Relief Act
              (FERA), there were still more problems that needed solutions, and
              quickly! High unemployment remained and there continued to be
              worries about the public’s welfare. The Civil Works Administration
              (CWA) was started as a subdivision of FERA with the goal of
              providing a short-term solution to get people back to work. The
              projects under CWA were more short term and aimed at unskilled
              laborers. A large amount of men and women were put to work in the
              winter of 1933 and 1934 as a result of this initiative. For
              example, roads were improved, bridges were constructed, airports
              were upgraded, and pipelines were repaired. &nbsp;&nbsp;

              The Farm Security Administration (FSA), created in 1937 under the
              Department of Agriculture, helped with rural rehabilitation, farm
              loans, and subsistence homestead programs. The FSA was not a
              relief agency, but instead it relied on a network of cooperation
              between states and county offices to determine which clients
              needed loans that could not get this credit somewhere else.
              Farmers could use these loans to buy land, equipment, livestock,
              or seeds. Additionally, the FSA assisted families by providing
              healthcare, education, and training programs for participating
              families. The goal of these measures was to help families become
              self-sustaining.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most memorable programs of the FSA is the collection of
              photographs that document the rural conditions from the
              Information Division of the Resettlement Administration. These
              photos helped to not only promote the programs of the RA, but to
              also show the people, cultures, and landscapes of rural America.

              President Franklin Roosevelt wanted to not only provide jobs for
              people, but also raise the country out of the Depression through
              innovative programs. Roosevelt specified that he wanted “a
              corporation clothed with the power of government but possessed of
              the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise.” In 1933,
              the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established with the
              intention of bringing modernization and organization to natural
              resources and energy to parts of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
              Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TVA, which exists today, is the nation’s largest public power
              provider. Along with providing the area with low-cost electricity,
              the TVA also manages natural resources and a wide range of
              environmental and technical issues.

              Harry Hopkins, the director of many of President Franklin
              Roosevelt’s New Deal Recovery programs, knew that by “giv[ing] a
              man a [handout]… you save his body and destroy his spirit. [But by
              giving] him a job… you save both body and spirit.” The Works
              Progress Administration (WPA) gave over 8.5 million people jobs,
              as well as boosting workers’ self-esteem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with the repair and construction of roads, bridges, public
              parks, and public buildings, the WPA also paid for federal art,
              theater, music, theatre, and writing programs. Many criticized the
              act of federal dollars going towards art programs, but Hopkins
              defended the decision by saying, “[artists] have got to eat just
              like other people.” By supporting tens of thousands of artists,
              over 2,500 murals and 17,000 sculptures were created for public
              buildings all over the country. The National Foundation for the
              Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities were two
              organizations created by the WPA that are still around today.

              The majority of people employed during this time were young men.
              The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) hired nearly three million
              young men between the ages seventeen and twenty-three to dig
              ditches, plant trees, fight fires, and build reservoirs, creating
              the foundation for the nation’s national and state parks. The men
              lived communally in camps designed after army barracks and were
              fed three meals a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              For their labor, they were paid $1 per day, two-thirds of which
              was automatically sent back to their homes. In addition to the
              hard labor, the men participated in sports and hobby clubs, as
              well as classes to help them prepare to get jobs once they left
              the CCC.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              About 250,000 African American men were employed by the CCC, with
              membership limits restricted to ten percent of the total
              workforce. They worked in segregated companies, but performed the
              same duties as their white counterparts, often under greater
              scrutiny and dealing with harsh racial bias by their supervisors.

              Women’s roles in the 1930s were typically relegated to those of
              housewife and mother. So many of the New Deal programs were not
              initially directed at them (although Eleanor Roosevelt did her
              best to change this). Most of the women were employed through the
              Works Progress Administration (WPA). Even so, in its peak year
              only 13.5 percent of those in the WPA program were women.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early in the program, women were given lower paying jobs such as
              sewing, bookbinding, caring for the elderly, and working in school
              lunch programs and nursery schools. Ellen Sullivan Woodward, as
              the Director of the Women’s and Professional Projects for the
              Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), gave library
              projects a high priority. Through the Library Project, librarians
              were sent into rural communities, by horseback if necessary, to
              provide library services where none had ever existed before.
              Woodward also created work programs for unemployed actors,
              writers, musicians, and artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another WPA program, the National Youth Administration (NYA),
              provided opportunities for young girls. NYA offered educational
              opportunities, work training, and financial aid for youth between
              ages sixteen and twenty-five.

              Minority groups were especially hard hit by the depression but
              were not always given equal opportunity for participation in the
              relief and recovery programs. A quarter of a million African
              Americans were employed in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
              though this amounted to only 10 percent of the jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to complaints from local community leaders, African American
              CCC members were forced to serve in segregated units. African
              Americans serving under the Tennessee Valley Authority lived in
              substandard housing compared to their white counterparts and
              African American tenant farmers suffered greatly from the policies
              put in place by the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA).
            </p>
            <p>
              With the increasing criticism of the New Deal’s discriminatory
              practices, some government officials such as Mary Macleod Bethune
              and Harold Ickes, worked to provide more educational opportunities
              to African Americans as well as roles in government.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, through the leadership of
              John Collier, sought “to restore Indian culture and heritage,
              address communal land base and land purchase issues, and
              regenerate tribal self-government.” While Collier’s efforts were
              often criticized, they brought a new consciousness about Native
              Americans to the country.

                Electricians from Brunswick Electric Membership Corporation
                (BEMC), Shallotte, NC. The BEMC was often referred to as the
                REA, or Rural Electrification Administration, by people living
                in this part of the country.
              </p>

            <p>
              Both the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the Works Progress
              Administration (WPA) strove to build and improve the public sphere
              by employing workers, both skilled and unskilled, to create public
              buildings and roads, and to bring essential utilities to
              Americans. Perhaps most notable is the role the PWA, WPA, TVA, and
              other New Deal agencies played in providing electricity and other
              basic services to rural areas of the US for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rural Electricity Administration (REA), for example, sought to
              make electricity and electric lines more easily available in rural
              areas of the country in order to redress disparities in
              electricity use between the US and Europe. Before the
              organization’s founding, only 11% of US farms had electricity; by
              1952, less than two decades after the founding of the REA, nearly
              all US farms had electricity. From electric lines to dams, public
              works projects boomed as a result of the New Deal, and many of the
              projects implemented by New Deal agencies served as integral steps
              in the development of today’s infrastructural and agricultural
              landscape.

            <p>
              Perhaps some of the most significant and long-lasting projects
              undertaken by New Deal agencies are those that facilitated
              transportation by creating and improving America’s infrastructural
              systems. Among the work done by the PWA and WPA, several projects
              aimed at increasing the ease of transportation within the US stand
              out for the extent to which their legacies outlasted the New Deal
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The PWA worked on over 11,000 road projects during its 10 years of
              operation. These projects include New York’s Triborough Bridge and
              Lincoln Tunnel. The Agency’s reach was not limited to road; the
              PWA is also responsible for electrifying the Pennsylvania Railroad
              along parts of the East Coast. The WPA also produced a number of
              projects that not only employed workers in dire need of
              employment, but also continue to this day to facilitate
              transportation in the US. From parkways to airports, these
              projects spurred economic development both during and after their
              construction, and have come to define American infrastructure in
              the time since the New Deal.

                First CCC workers in front of the Bryson City, NC park office.
                The CCC planted trees, built park structures and fire towers,
                created trails, and performed landscaping that has shaped what
                the National Parks are today.

              At the height of its operations, the Civilian Conservation Corps
              (CCC), a driving force in the expansion and improvement of the
              national park system, employed some 300,000 workers. Members of
              the CCC engaged closely with efforts to protect natural resources
              and conserve the American natural environment by combating soil
              erosion, building fire roads, creating trails in national parks,
              and planting 3 billion trees over the agency’s nine year lifespan.

              FDR was himself a nature enthusiast and a proponent of
              conservation. During his tenure as president, he moved to improve
              and expand the existing National Parks Service. At the
              recommendation of National Park Service director Horace Albright,
              Roosevelt added 20 military parks, historic battlefields, and
              monuments (including Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty) to
              the Park Service’s network. He also created several new national
              parks, including Isle Royale National Park, Joshua Tree, the Dry
              Tortugas, and the Channel Islands. These parks, and the
              improvements made to the National Park Service as a result of the
              New Deal, still endure, attracting visitors from the US and
              abroad.
