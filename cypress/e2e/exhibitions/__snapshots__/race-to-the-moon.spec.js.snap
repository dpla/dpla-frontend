              >After World War II, there was non-violent, political hostility
              between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR), which
              became known as the Cold War. During this contentious time, both
              nations created rockets for long-range military weaponry. The Cold
              War catalyzed the expansion of rocket technology and each
              country’s desire to conquer outer space. Not only did America want
              to explore one of the last frontiers, it also wanted to claim
              technological dominance over the USSR and ensure America’s title
              of superiority in a time of unease and tension. In 1955, the US
              and the USSR each announced plans to launch a satellite into
              orbit. Who would be the first to succeed?</span

              >On October 4, 1957, the USSR launched Sputnik I into orbit,
              taking the lead in the Space Race. Only four months later, the US
              successfully launched its own satellite, the Explorer I, into
              space. In the wake of these first successful orbital space
              flights, President Dwight D. Eisenhower recommended to the US
              Congress that a civilian agency should be established to direct
              non-military space activities. Thus, the National Aeronautics and
              Space Administration (NASA) was born and the Space Race was
              underway. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the American space
              program and its new classes of astronauts achieved breakthroughs
              in science and space exploration</span

            <p>
              Throughout the 1950s and 60s, the United States was locked in
              competition with its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union (USSR), to
              prove supremacy through space travel. Along with the heated
              nuclear arms race, the space race became a way for each country to
              prove their technological prowess. It had its roots in ideology
              too, as both Cold War powers tried to prove the strength of their
              nation’s economy and politics through the success of their space
              programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NASA Mercury space programs began in 1958 and were the first
              manned space flights, introducing the American public to its first
              astronauts. Project Mercury made six flights with astronauts
              aboard between 1961 and 1963 with the goal of determining
              capabilities for sending humans into space, as well as orbiting a
              manned craft around the Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              After being the first to launch a satellite into orbit in October
              1957, the USSR advanced ahead of the US and its Mercury program
              again with another space exploration milestone. On April 12, 1961,
              cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit in the Vostok I,
              making him the first man in space. Three weeks after Gagarin
              orbited the Earth, the US sent Alan Shepard into space in the
              first Mercury flight, the Freedom 7. Shepard’s flight went
              perfectly but the US was still one step behind the USSR.
            </p>
            <p>
              After two defeats by the Soviets, the US was desperate for a win,
              and the next critical milestone was sending a man to the Moon.
              Since neither country had the necessary rocket technology to
              achieve this goal yet, the US would not be starting at a
              disadvantage. It became President John F. Kennedy’s goal to land a
              man on the Moon by the end of the decade.

                President John F. Kennedy delivered his "We choose to go to the
                moon" speech at Rice University Stadium in Houston, Texas, on
                September 12, 1962. It highlighted the need for a national
                agenda to land people on the Moon and return them safely to
                Earth.

                >After the United States was upstaged by the Soviet Union with
                Yuri Gagarin's successful spaceflight, America felt the pressure
                to catch up and overtake the Soviet Union in the race. Support
                grew for President Kennedy’s vision of an American man on the
                Moon, which before Gagarin’s flight was widely considered too
                expensive. On May 25, 1961, Kennedy went before Congress to ask
                for financial support for what would become the Apollo space
                program. His speech, titled "Special Message on Urgent National
                Needs,” stressed that “no single space project in this period
                will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the
                long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult
                or expensive to accomplish.”</span

            <p>
              After appealing to Congress, Kennedy rallied the support of
              American citizens with his famous Rice University speech on
              September 12, 1962. In this speech, he framed his dream of sending
              a man to the Moon as being both instrumental to US security and as
              a way for Americans to conquer the next unexplored frontier: "We
              meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for
              progress, in a State noted for strength, and we stand in need of
              all three." This speech was an implicit challenge to the Soviet
              Union. However, Nikita Khrushchev—the Soviet Premier—responded
              with silence. He refused to publicly confirm that the Soviet Union
              was participating in a race to the Moon.

                >In 1969, America witnessed Neil Armstrong take mankind’s first
                step on the Moon, leaving footprints on its surface from the
                boots of his spacesuit. Spacesuits like Armstrong’s protected
                astronauts from the deadly conditions in space. They maintained
                a steady pressure, allowed for movement, regulated body
                temperature, supplied oxygen, eliminated carbon dioxide, and
                collected bodily waste.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Adapted from previously constructed suits made for high-altitude
              military pilots, spacesuits were originally designed for pressure
              stabilization. Because there is zero pressure in space, the suit
              worn by the first US astronaut in space, Alan Shepard, was
              designed to protect him in case of depressurization inside the
              cabin of Project Mercury’s Freedom 7. Luckily, no Mercury
              spacecraft ever lost pressure during a mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              The suits evolved so astronauts could travel into space and leave
              their spacecraft. When Ed White became the first American to
              perform a spacewalk in 1965, he remained connected to the ship via
              an umbilical cord that provided life support. For independence on
              the lunar surface, astronauts used a portable life support system
              (PLSS) worn like a backpack. Due to differences in gravity, the
              suits and PLSS combined weighed thirty pounds on the Moon but a
              hefty 180 pounds on Earth.

                >American enthusiasm for interstellar exploration was built on
                decades of popular culture that imagined life on other planets.
                Fictionalized space heroes gave rise to an eager public
                anticipation of NASA’s declaration to land on the Moon. During
                this time, space-themed entertainment was incredibly popular,
                like the Flash Gordon ride at the 1939 World's Fair that allowed
                excited riders to experience a rocketship simulation. In 1928,
                the amazing Buck Rogers made his first appearance in Amazing
                Stories comic books as a swashbuckling adventurer of space.
                Readers fell in love with his stories and Buck soon expanded to
                the funny pages, radio, and movies. Merchandise and space toys
                quickly followed—toy guns, tin rockets, and breakfast cereal
                prize membership pins were all part of the Buck Rogers
                franchise.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The popularity of Flash and Buck led to an increase in radio show
              space adventures with Superman in 1940. Televisions shows, like
              Space Patrol and Commando Cody, started producing their own
              merchandise and many other space themed toys debuted, capitalizing
              on the space trend. The public’s positive reaction to these pop
              culture landmarks may well have influenced the political embrace
              of space and America’s readiness to see Kennedy’s dream of a man
              on the Moon fulfilled.

                which landed on the Moon. However, with support declining in
                Congress, President Richard Nixon only backed future funding for
                a space shuttle to facilitate development of permanent space
                stations. The Soviet Union, after their loss in the race to the
                Moon, shifted their focus to orbital space stations and, on
                April 19, 1971, successfully launched Earth's first space
                station, Salyut 1.</span

              On July 17, 1975, during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the United
              States and the Soviet Union performed the first joint space
              docking between two nations. This was the first of many
              collaborations in space between these former rivals. Notably,
              between 1995 and 1998, astronauts from both nations lived on the
              Russian space station, Mir. In 1998, construction of the
              International Space Station began, a collaborative, global venture
              between Japan, Canada, Brazil, Europe, Russia, and the US that
              remains ongoing.

                  possible had an important historic impact, not only for the
                  United States and Soviet Union, but for the rest of the world.
                  Space exploration required innovations in a range of fields,
                  such as computer science and medicine, and NASA technology has
                  even made its way back down to Earth, impacting developments
                  in everything from prosthetics and cancer treatments to LED
                  lights. Today, NASA and US astronauts and scientists continue
                  building on the creativity and exploration of their
                  predecessors in the 1960s, exploring new planets and recently

              The United States’ Gemini project, a second manned spaceflight
              program, began in 1961 and helped determine and test the
              requirements for NASA to successfully reach the Moon. The Gemini’s
              objectives were to test astronauts in space for long periods of
              time, vehicle docking and orbiting procedures, and safe spacecraft
              reentry and landing methods. The Gemini flights were the first
              manned missions to involve multiple crew members and explore
              long-term space travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              The USSR Voskhod spacecraft launched in 1965 and on March 18th
              cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov achieved the first ever spacewalk,
              spending twenty minutes outside of the craft attached to an
              umbilical cord system. Three months later, astronaut Edward White,
              aboard the Gemini IV, became the first American to ever walk in
              space. White was also the first to use jet propulsion which
              allowed him to propel his body in the opposite direction and
              purposefully maneuver his actions during his spacewalk. Although
              the Soviet Union appeared to be ahead of the US in the Space Race,
              NASA was following a strategically planned program to ensure a
              moon landing with the Apollo missions in the coming years.

            <p>
              On December 21, 1968, the United States’ Apollo 8 mission was
              launched and made a six-day trip to orbit the Moon, circling it a
              total of ten times. Astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell, and
              William Anders were the first to take deep space pictures of
              Earth. Watching as Earth rose over the Moon, all three astronauts
              began snapping photographs, causing some dispute over who actually
              produced what became one of the most iconic images in American
              history. The public was able to experience the Apollo 8 mission
              with the crew via live television coverage, and on Christmas Eve
              the crew’s legendary Genesis reading was broadcast over radio
              transmission to everyone listening back home.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Apollo 8 achieved many firsts, including the first manned mission
              in the Saturn V spacecraft, sending men around the Moon and
              returning them safely to Earth. NASA took a risk sending the
              astronauts to orbit the Moon, knowing that transmission would be
              lost once the spacecraft was directly behind it. Without direction
              from the NASA command center, the crew successfully burned the
              engines at the exact position needed to curve the spacecraft
              around the Moon’s back and return home. The United States was
              getting closer to conquering the Moon.

                initiated an attempt to achieve a lunar landing. Commanded by
                Neil Armstrong and piloted by Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins,
                Apollo 11 launched on July 16, 1969, from Cape Kennedy (now
                known as Cape Canaveral), Florida, with a trajectory to the
                Moon.</span

                  one of the most historic moments to ever broadcast over live
                  television. Using more fuel than expected, the descent of
                  Apollo 11’s lunar module was rocky, and the mission came close
                  to being aborted. However, the astronauts skillfully landed
                  the module on the Moon on July 20. With America watching,
                  Armstrong and Aldrin stepped onto its surface and planted an
                  American flag in its soil. “That’s one small step for man, one
                  giant leap for mankind,” Armstrong proclaimed. The crew spent
                  two and a half hours on the Moon conducting experiments,
                  taking photographs, collecting samples of lunar surface
                  material, and placing their calling card (a commemorative
                  patch and plaque) on the surface for the next being to find.
                  On July 24, Apollo 11 hurtled through Earth’s atmosphere and
                  jettisoned straight into the Pacific Ocean where the crew was
                  safely recovered. The race was over—the United States had
                  won.</span

                >The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 became the catalyst
                for possible cooperation in space between the United States and
                the Soviet Union. This confrontation, during which Kennedy
                sought to overthrow the communist Castro regime, brought both
                nations to the brink of launching nuclear weapons. After a tense
                period, both nations were compelled to avoid the devastation
                that would result from nuclear warfare. In August 1963, the
                Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed
                the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned all nuclear tests
                underwater, in the atmosphere, and in space.</span

            <p>
              Following the signing, on September 20, 1963, John F. Kennedy made
              a speech before the United Nations General Assembly proposing that
              the US and the Soviet Union join forces to reach the Moon. The
              joint expedition was intended to improve American-Soviet
              relations. However, the political climate at the time would not
              support such a bold proposal for cooperation. Most Americans
              firmly believed that the US would be the first nation on the Moon.
              The nation's attitude was clear when, in December 1963, Congress
              passed a bill stating, "No part of any appropriation made
              available to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by
              this Act shall be used for expenses of participating in a manned
              lunar landing to be carried out jointly by the United States and
              any other country without consent of the Congress."

                Antarctic as an international area that would "be used
                exclusively for peaceful purposes [...] with the interests of
                science and the progress of all mankind." &nbsp;President Dwight
                D. Eisenhower initiated the negotiations that brought about the
                treaty. He believed that, like the Antarctic, outer space should
                also be a peaceful territory. In a speech to the United Nations
                General Assembly on September 22, 1960, Eisenhower called for
                the nations of the world to extend the principles of the
                Antarctic Treaty to outer space. However, his Presidential term
                ended shortly thereafter and John F. Kennedy was elected.</span

                  >Kennedy's administration continued to push for Eisenhower's
                  ideal of peace in outer space and supported an October 1963 UN
                  resolution that called upon nations to refrain from
                  introducing weapons of mass destruction into space. After
                  Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, his successor,
                  Lyndon B. Johnson, took up the cause. Under Johnson,
                  Eisenhower's vision of a peace treaty for space was finally
                  put into action on October 10, 1967. The Outer Space Treaty
                  exists to this day and forms the basis for international space
                  law. The treaty states, among other things, that no nation can
                  lay claim to space or any celestial bodies and that any
                  exploration of space should be done for the benefit of every
                  country.

                for a spot on the Mercury project flight crew, were military
                test pilots. There were only a few requirements for the initial
                application process which included age and hours logged in
                flight. A key qualification, however, was a height of under
                5’11”, since the Mercury spacecraft was small. After rounds of
                rigorous physical tests and exams, 110 pilot applicants were
                narrowed down to seven NASA astronauts, later known as the
                Mercury 7, in April 1959. Among the original seven astronauts
                was Alan Shepard, a Navy test pilot who became the first

                Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, and the other NASA
                astronauts had to simulate the lunar walk in its entirety. This
                included picking up rock samples on a fake moonscape and
                practicing planting the American flag on the Moon’s surface,
                sometimes using a simulator to mimic reduced gravity conditions.

                  1969, many other astronauts broke barriers in the NASA
                  training program. In the 1960s, the astronaut training program
                  was limited to white men. In 1983, aerospace engineer and
                  astronaut Guion Stewart Bluford, Jr., became the first African
                  American man in space. Four years later, Sally Ride became the
                  first woman in space, after replying to an ad for the
                  astronaut program in the Stanford University student
                  newspaper. In 1992, aboard the Endeavour shuttle, astronaut
                  Mae Jemison became the first African American women to travel
                  in space. Jemison was inspired to travel to space, she later
                  said, by the character of Lieutenant Uhura on the 1960s

              It was unclear if normal digestion occurred when in outer space.
              Aboard Friendship 7 in 1962, John Glenn consumed applesauce in a
              tube and sugar tablets with water, making him the first American
              to ingest food in space. The space food developed by NASA next was
              generally unappetizing, consisting of puréed food sucked through a
              straw or small cubes of dehydrated food. Crumbs posed potential
              problems as they could become lodged in instrumentation or even an
              astronaut’s nostril.

                  >With the Gemini missions, during the early to mid 1960s, came
                  freeze-dried food that was easily rehydrated by injecting
                  water into the package. By the Apollo missions of the late
                  1960s to early 1970s, astronauts could use utensils, which
                  were attached to trays with magnets or Velcro to keep them
                  from floating away. Pouches, or wet packs, were also
                  introduced, letting astronauts enjoy beef sandwiches and
                  chocolate pudding without rehydration. The wetness of the food
                  allowed it to remain on the spoon instead of floating away. On
                  Christmas Eve, 1968, crewmen aboard Apollo 8 even enjoyed a
                  fruitcake wetpack.</span

                On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space
                in this Mercury capsule. He named it "Freedom 7," the number
                signifying the seven Mercury astronauts; NASA called the mission
                Mercury-Redstone 3 (MR-3).&nbsp;Courtesy of the National Air and

                >The first spacecraft launched by the United States was part of
                Project Mercury, which began in 1958 and flew six manned space
                flights between 1961 and 1963. This cone-shaped capsule held one
                man and was equipped with parachutes to slow its descent and an
                escape tower to assist astronauts in an emergency. Of those six
                manned Mercury missions, four were orbital (where the spacecraft
                is in space for an orbit around the planet) and two were
                suborbital flights (which reaches space but doesn’t
                orbit).</span

              Following Project Mercury, the Gemini Program flew twelve missions
              in the mid-1960s, ten of which were manned. These capsules were
              bigger, holding two astronauts, and were critical to the success
              of the later Apollo Program and moon landing. Unlike the Mercury
              spacecraft, the Gemini vehicles did not have an escape tower and
              instead relied on ejection seats to launch the crew away from the
              spacecraft at low altitudes when it was necessary to disembark.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Apollo spacecraft was the next big innovation in the space
              program. It contained three separate sections, or modules
              (command, service, and lunar), which made it possible for the US
              to successfully land on the Moon. Once in lunar orbit, the lunar
              module shuttled astronauts to the surface of the Moon and returned
              them to the relative safety of the command and service modules in
              orbit. Six of the Apollo missions landed twelve men on the Moon
              and safely returned them to Earth.

                >After launching the Soviet’s Sputnik I in 1957 and the United
                States’ Explorer I in 1958, scientists on both sides began
                acquiring non-human subjects for space experimentation. Since
                the late 1940s, a variety of animals were used in US military
                flight experiments. During the Space Race, experimentation
                included testing the effects of the harsh conditions of space.
                After a stray Soviet dog, Laika, became the first animal to
                achieve Earth orbit in Sputnik II in 1957, the use of animals as
                test subjects greatly increased. This was particularly true for
                chimpanzees, who were often used to test the effects of gravity
                and high-speed motion. The chimps were tested in small metal
                capsules and controlled by electric shocks. Unfortunately, the
                chimpanzees were sometimes killed or severely injured during
                tests, though their involvement ensured human safety during
                actual space travel.</span

              In 1961, the US test subject, Ham, became famous as the first
              chimpanzee in space. During his flight, technical difficulties
              occurred, forcing him to go higher and faster than anticipated.
              However, Ham splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean and even
              posed for pictures afterwards. Ham’s mission was an important
              precursor to Alan Shepard’s Freedom 7 launch later that year.
              Another famous chimpanzee, Enos, achieved Earth orbit in the same
              year, orbiting twice before successfully returning home. His
              flight paved the way for John Glenn’s successful orbit in 1962.

                >The great accomplishments of the National Aeronautics and Space
                Administration (NASA) programs were the culmination of many
                smaller operations behind the scenes. The teams at NASA,
                including crewmembers and mathematicians, were invaluable assets
                and played a major role in the success of the space
                programs.</span

              Each spacecraft required mission crews, helping guide the flight
              back on Earth. While they never left the planet, these crewmembers
              made it possible for early spacecraft to, among other operations,
              procure photographs of space and function safely during flight. A
              notable member of the mission crew for the Mercury, Gemini, and
              Apollo missions was Guenter Wendt, the pad leader who oversaw
              flight safety. Wendt was primarily responsible for spacecraft
              tests, checkouts, and launch operations—he was the mission
              crewmember that saw the astronauts off before liftoff.

              During the space programs, a significant number of women worked in
              professional positions at NASA. Referred to as “human computers,”
              they performed mathematical equations and calculations by hand.
              “Have the girl run the numbers,” John Glenn requested from space.
              These women did more than just computations and reciting numbers,
              though. Many, like Sharon Stack and Katherine Johnson, were
              professionals who published scholarly articles during a time when
              it was very rare for women to do so. However, there were still
              many institutional barriers for women interested in other jobs at
              NASA—especially as astronauts. The first training class of women
              astronauts were selected by NASA in 1978, Sally Ride among them.
              It wouldn’t be until 1983 that Ride became the first woman
              astronaut sent to space, and almost another decade later before an
              African American woman, Mae Jemison, made it to space.

                >People were eager for any information on NASA's space programs,
                which was released to the public through a variety of outlets
                and media. To encourage the continued support of the general
                public, the US government released material that would
                capitalize on the public's excitement about outer space and
                build anticipation for the Space Race. This climate provided
                President Kennedy with a positive platform to make public
                appearances regarding the space program and to promote
                newsworthy events like aeronautical award ceremonies or NASA
                technological breakthroughs. Much of the government-produced
                promotional material came in the form of informational films and
                posters, distributed both at home and abroad. Since the number
                of people that had actually been to space was very small,
                pictures and art depicting space were especially
                influential.</span

              The greatest public display of the space program’s success was the
              live television broadcast of John Glenn and Neil Armstrong during
              the Apollo 11 mission. From the comfort of their own homes,
              America visited space with their newfound heroes as they walked on
              the Moon. For years, this event was commemorated with stamps,
              posters, buttons, and artists’ renditions.

                women put into extraordinary situations. Before their husbands
                flew aboard the first Mercury missions in the 1960s, Gordon
                Cooper’s wife was a licensed pilot and Gus Grissom’s wife worked
                full time to pay for Gus’ education. Commonly referred to as
                Togethersville, Clear Lake City, Texas, was where early
                astronauts resided and their wives created a support
                system.</span

              <span
                >Besides being married to astronauts, these women had something
                in common—they were expected to personify a hero's wife and
                provide support for their husband's involvement in space
                missions. It was a heightened experience to what many
                stay-at-home women in the 1950s and 1960s experienced, coupled
                with intense media scrutiny. The Mercury astronauts and their
                wives, for example, signed a lucrative deal with </span

              ><span
                >magazine, giving it access to the families’ private lives and
                homes while their husbands were both at home and in space.
                Inside the magazine’s pages were full color photos of their
                families’ vacations and their husbands on the living room couch.
                They shared their hopes and their fears with reporters, and even
                penned columns themselves. However, the publicity took its toll.
                There were thirty married astronauts during the Gemini and
                Apollo programs—all but seven marriages ended in divorce.</span

              Love wasn’t always lost, however. After returning to Earth, John
              Glenn would switch his briefcase from one hand to the other in
              view of cameras as a way of telling his wife that he loved her.
              Some astronauts even named parts of the Moon after their wives,
              such as Mount Marilyn, after Jim Lovell's wife.

                  when he is returning until he gets home. But changes, delays,
                  and disrupted schedules are so typical of service life that
                  you just learn to accept them. You learn to take the things
                  your husband does in stride, too.”
