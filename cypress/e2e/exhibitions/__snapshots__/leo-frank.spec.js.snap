          <p>
            On April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day, thirteen-year-old Mary
            Phagan was murdered at the National Pencil Company in Atlanta,
            Georgia. Leo Frank, the Jewish, New York-raised superintendent of
            the National Pencil Company, was charged with the crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Atlanta’s economy was transforming from rural and
            agrarian to urban and industrial. Resources for investing in new
            industry came from Northern states, as did most industrial leaders,
            like Leo Frank. Many of the workers in these new industrial
            facilities were children, like Mary Phagan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next two years, Leo Frank’s legal case became a national
            story with a highly publicized, controversial trial and lengthy
            appeal process that profoundly affected Jewish communities in
            Georgia and the South, and impacted the careers of lawyers,
            politicians, and publishers.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the early twentieth century, Jewish communities had become
            well-established in most major Southern cities, continuing a path of
            migration that began during colonial times. The Leo Frank case and
            its aftermath revealed lingering regional hostilities from the Civil
            War and Reconstruction, intensified existing racial and cultural
            inequalities (particularly anti-Semitism), embodied socioeconomic
            problems (such as child labor), and exposed the brutality of
            lynching in the South.

            <h2>North/South Dichotomy</h2>
            <p>
              In 1913, Atlanta was less than fifty years removed from the Civil
              War. Economic divides and resentments between North and South
              remained. The siege and burning of Atlanta, Sherman’s March to the
              Sea, and Reconstruction were bitter memories for many Southerners,
              and the Southern economy still lagged behind the rest of the
              country.
            </p>
            <p>
              People and industry from the North migrated to the South after the
              Civil War. Many Northerners who came to the South did so for
              economic reasons, and brought with them capital and experience.
              Although the money was welcome, Northerners who owned businesses
              were often resented and deemed “carpetbaggers” and “scalawags.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Resentment of Northern-controlled industry is exemplified by this
              quote from the Atlanta Constitution on &nbsp;April 27, 1913, by
              Dr. Charles Lee: “Our principles were not defeated when we
              surrendered at Appomattox. . . .There are other enemies, bitter
              ones, that must be fought—emigration, labor, the double standard
              of child labor and white slavery. . .” In this historical
              re-imagining, slavery becomes the crisis of child and female
              exploitation created by outsiders, but against which native-born
              white Americans from North and South could ultimately unite.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Southern states, the Confederacy was cherished and
              romanticized. Confederate Memorial Day, established in 1874 and
              observed in Georgia on April 26, annually featured parades with
              Confederate veterans. In 1913, Georgia’s Confederate Memorial Day
              fell on a Saturday and a large parade was held in Atlanta to
              celebrate the holiday.

            <h2>Crime and Arrest</h2>
            <p>
              Confederate Memorial Day fell on Saturday, April 26, 1913. The
              National Pencil Company in Atlanta, Georgia, was closed, but
              superintendent Leo Frank was in the office working on a financial
              report and handing out wages. Thirteen-year-old employee Mary
              Phagan collected her pay around noon; she did not return home.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early hours of April 27, African American night watchman
              Newt Lee discovered Phagan’s body in the factory basement and
              immediately called the police. Phagan had been strangled and
              dragged across the floor. Two crudely written notes implicating “a
              negro” were found nearby. Initial suspicion fell on Lee. When Leo
              Frank was contacted about the murder, the police noted he was very
              nervous. But when he was brought in for questioning, Frank denied
              knowledge of the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
              The National Pencil Company’s sweeper, an African American man
              named Jim Conley, was discovered washing a bloody shirt and was
              also questioned by police. He denied any involvement, claiming he
              could not read or write. But after intense interrogation, Conley’s
              story changed. He admitted writing the notes, but claimed that he
              did so upon orders from Leo Frank. Despite the inconsistencies in
              Conley’s story (which changed four times), the police and
              solicitor general Hugh M. Dorsey believed him. Leo Frank was
              arrested and indicted for the murder of Mary Phagan. Jim Conley
              was the primary witness.

            <h2><span>Conviction and Sentence</span></h2>
            <p>
              In final arguments, solicitor Hugh M. Dorsey—in support of the
              prosecution—painted Frank as a Jekyll and Hyde figure. Conversely,
              the defense team of Reuben Arnold and Luther Rosser claimed Frank
              was an honest, upstanding citizen who was a victim of
              anti-Semitism, and emphasized that the real perpetrator was Jim
              Conley.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dorsey had the last word, and with it he destroyed Frank’s
              character and portrayed Phagan as a symbol of lost innocence. By
              referring to great Jewish historic figures in his closing
              statements, he deflected charges of anti-Semitism and asserted
              that Frank’s deviant behavior dishonored the Jewish people and the
              girl he was accused of brutally murdering. Dorsey’s words were
              relayed to the crowd outside and greeted with thunderous applause.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the verdict was read, Judge Roan consulted Frank’s
              attorneys. Fearing mob violence if the jury acquitted Frank, they
              mutually agreed neither they nor Frank should be in court when the
              decision was read out. The jury deliberated less than two hours
              before returning a guilty verdict. When Dorsey emerged from the
              courthouse, he was cheered and carried on the shoulders of the
              crowd. Informed of the verdict, Frank again proclaimed his
              innocence.

                sociopolitical organizations of the day, including both
                advocates for and against racial violence. The first of these
                was the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith (ADL), founded in
                1913 by Sigmund Livingston, a Chicago attorney</span

              ><span
                >the &nbsp;same year as the Leo Frank trial. Although the
                creation of the ADL preceded the Leo Frank case, Frank’s
                experience bolstered Livingston’s belief that American Jews
                needed an organization that would challenge American
                anti-Semitism. The ADL remains an influential civil rights
                organization.</span

            <p>
              The second was the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which was revived in
              Georgia at the end of the Frank case. Originally founded after the
              end of the Civil War, the KKK had been shut down by federal
              intervention during Reconstruction. Inflammatory editorials penned
              by Thomas Watson soon after Frank’s lynching incentivized the
              newly formed Klan, who burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain on
              Thanksgiving Day, 1915, to signify the organization’s rebirth.
              Several members of Leo Frank’s lynching party were also charter
              members of the new Klan.

                  of five million people by the mid-1920s. Internal feuding and
                  the exposure of Klan violence by journalists who infiltrated
                  the organization eventually led to a steep decline in the
                  group’s political influence by the late 1940s.</span

            <p>
              Racial tension in Atlanta exploded during a violent race riot in
              1906, caused by sensationalist press reports (none verified) of
              white women attacked by African American men. White mobs attacked
              African Americans in streets, homes, and businesses over several
              days. Martial law was declared and state militia restored order.
              Dozens of African Americans were killed; many more were wounded.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1913, Atlanta’s population was one-third African American. Jim
              Crow laws mandated segregation for African Americans in all areas
              of life, denying them the right to vote and access to public areas
              and accommodations while discriminating against them in housing
              and employment. Jim Crow laws were the legal means of
              counteracting the freedoms that African Americans obtained after
              emancipation and the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
              Amendments. And often, they were supplemented and enforced using
              an extralegal method —lynching.
            </p>
            <p>
              All African Americans were expected to act deferentially to white
              people; refusal could result in violence. Most lynching victims
              were African American men. Lynchings were horrific spectacles
              witnessed by large crowds that included children; the victim was
              often brutally tortured first. Accusations of rape were often
              impetus for lynching, but lynchings could also occur whenever an
              African American was accused of violating a Jim Crow law.

            <p>
              In 1913, Atlanta’s economy was transforming from agrarian to
              industrial. From 1900 to 1905, Atlanta manufacturing increased by
              seventy-five percent, and the city had become a hub for
              transporting agricultural products. While the state of Georgia
              remained primarily rural and agrarian, Atlanta was becoming an
              urban, industrial city. A symbol of Atlanta’s new industrial
              growth, the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills was one of Atlanta’s
              largest employers in 1913. It was owned by the Elsas family,
              prominent members of Atlanta’s Jewish community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Economic development in Atlanta was promoted by Henry W. Grady,
              managing editor of the <em>Atlanta Constitution</em>. He solicited
              Northern investment in Southern business by emphasizing the appeal
              of accessible Southern labor and selling Atlanta as part of the
              “New South.” Grady’s “New South” emphasized the industrial
              progress that underscored the distance from the Civil War and it
              concealed violence employed to maintain a familiar racial order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working conditions in many Southern manufacturing facilities were
              difficult. Factories were hot in summer, cold in winter, and
              sanitary conditions were poor. But the issue most prevalent in
              1913 was child labor. While most Southern states set a minimum age
              of twelve for child workers, on April 26, 1913, the Atlanta
              Georgian reported that Georgia’s child labor standards were the
              nation’s worst, with factories employing children as young as ten.
            </p>
            <p>
              The National Pencil Company in Atlanta exemplified these
              industrial conditions: the factory was supervised by Leo Frank, a
              Northerner, and Southern girls like Mary Phagan were hired to work
              low-wage jobs.

                  ><em>Godey's Magazine</em>, begun in 1830 by Louis A. Godey,
                  was by far the most popular women's periodical of its day.
                  Achieving a circulation of 150,000 before the war, it was
                  anxiously awaited by its many fans, who read and re-read the
                  sentimental stories and poems, studied and copied the
                  fashions, and even cut out and framed the engravings. The key
                  to its success was the section of fashion plates, which were
                  hand-colored by more than 100 women employed by Godey.
                  Sentiment was abundant, and politics were excluded, but much
                  on the education of women appeared. This particular image is
                  from Vol. LII., from January to June, 1856.&nbsp;</span

                >In 1913, some white Southerners still sought the restoration of
                antebellum culture of honor, particularly what they had lost
                during the Reconstruction era. They clung to ideals of womanhood
                that glorified virtue and purity. A model Southern lady was
                virtuous, modest, and pious. She was happy to maintain a home,
                raise children, care for the sick, sew, tend a garden, and be a
                dutiful wife. Male investment in this ideal was so pronounced
                that preserving the characteristics of Southern “belles” was
                considered a means of preserving Southern honor.</span

            <p>
              Women far outnumbered men in Georgia after the Civil War, and many
              were forced out of economic necessity to labor alongside men as
              sharecroppers, tenant farmers, or as mill and factory laborers.
              Their position as laborers contradicted the deep-seated ideals of
              white Southern womanhood that remained in the collective mindset,
              and thus, the ideal of Southern womanhood faced challenges.

                  women could result in violence from mobs or organized groups.
                  The Ku Klux Klan’s oath even included the phrase “to be of
                  special protection to female friends, widows, and their
                  households,” conflating their resistance to economic and
                  political change in the South with the sexuality of white
                  women.</span

                >Jews first immigrated to Atlanta in the 1840s, soon after the
                city was founded. They came from Germany, and from coastal
                cities like Savannah and Charleston. Savannah’s Jewish settlers
                had established the first congregation in the South.</span

              Most of Atlanta’s Jewish community was comprised of merchants, who
              emblemized Henry W. Grady’s “New South” vision to stimulate
              Southern industry by cooperating with Northern enterprises. As
              their businesses thrived, the Jewish population in Atlanta grew
              from 26 to 4,000 between 1850 and 1910. And by 1910, Jews
              comprised 2.6 percent of Atlanta’s population.
            </p>
            <p>
              Southern Jews occasionally found that economic and social changes
              contributed to the rise of anti-Semitic rhetoric and attitudes
              that portrayed them as outsiders. They were often held responsible
              for disappointments in times of crisis and uncertainty, such as
              the loss of the Civil War and agricultural depression in the late
              nineteenth century.

                  twentieth century. Fear of the technological and social
                  changes brought about by industrialization gave impetus to the
                  Populist movement, which included its share of spokespersons
                  who blamed Jews for financially exploiting farmers and
                  laborers. Among those Populists was US senator and newspaper
                  editor, Thomas E. (Tom) Watson.</span

              Leo Frank’s trial took place from July 28 to August 26, 1913.
              Major participants included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Jim Conley</strong>: sweeper at National Pencil Company;
                primary witness for prosecution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hugh M. Dorsey</strong>: solicitor general (prosecutor)
                for the Atlanta Judicial Circuit. Dorsey worked closely,
                although not always harmoniously, with police to prepare their
                case.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Leo Frank</strong>: defendant</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lucille and Rae Frank</strong>: Frank’s wife, Lucille,
                and his mother, Rae, attended each day of the trial. Both women
                publicly professed their belief in Frank’s innocence and
                criticized the investigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Newt Lee</strong>: night watchman at National Pencil
                Company; Lee discovered Mary Phagan’s body.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Alonzo Mann</strong>: Frank’s office boy and a character
                witness.
              </li>
              <li><strong>L. S. Roan</strong>: judge assigned to case.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Luther Rosser and Reuben Arnold</strong>: lead defense
                attorneys. Rosser had an outstanding reputation as a trial
                lawyer who specialized in cross-examination.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>William Smith</strong>: Conley’s attorney; prepared
                Conley for cross-examination.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Jury</strong>: composed of all white men.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Crowds</strong>: standing-room only, plus many more
                outside the courtroom. The crowd, which favored the prosecution,
                responded loudly to some court actions.
              </li>

                testimony was so lurid that Judge L. S. Roan removed women from
                the courtroom. Conley claimed to serve as a lookout for Frank
                while he had sexual relations with young girls, and that Frank
                had even established signals for Conley to lock and unlock his
                office.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Conley stated that Frank commanded him to “watch out” when Mary
              Phagan arrived. Shortly after, Conley heard a scream. When Conley
              was signaled to unlock the door, a shaken Frank said that Phagan
              accidentally hit her head while resisting him. According to
              Conley, Frank first asked for help moving her body, then together,
              Conley and Frank dragged Phagan into a corner of the basement.
              After returning to the office, Frank dictated notes and ordered
              Conley to place them near Phagan’s body. Conley said that Frank
              then bribed him to “keep his mouth shut.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Frank’s attorneys vigorously attacked Conley, who admitted lying
              initially, but ultimately held to his assertions. Unable to break
              Conley’s testimony, the defense moved it be stricken from the
              record. When Judge Roan denied the motion, cheering broke out in
              the courtroom, prompting Roan to threaten vacating the room if
              order was not restored. Solicitor Hugh M. Dorsey soon rested the
              state’s case.

            <p>
              Leo Frank’s lawyers challenged Jim Conley’s credibility,
              demonstrated that Frank did not have time to commit the crime, and
              collected testimony from multiple character witnesses. This was
              followed by a four-hour statement from Frank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frank’s defense drew attention to Conley’s lies and criminal
              record. Witnesses testified to Conley’s dubious behavior,
              particularly on April 26, the day of the murder. By showing
              detailed account sheets Frank was working on that day, the defense
              argued Frank was too preoccupied to do what Conley had claimed.
              Numerous witnesses testified to Frank’s good character, including
              Alonzo Mann, Frank’s office boy. Mann stated that he worked April
              26, but did not hear or see Frank do anything unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, Frank took the stand. He spoke calmly but firmly,
              asserting Conley’s tale was fabricated, and that detectives
              distorted his statements to incriminate him. Frank admitted to
              being nervous after hearing of the murder, noting that any man in
              his position would be. He stated that Phagan came in for her pay
              soon after noon, left his office, and he never saw her alive
              again. He worked on a financial report, and then went home. He
              never saw Conley that day.
            </p>
            <p>Soon after Frank’s statement, the defense rested.</p>

            <p>
              Over the lengthy appeals process, the Leo Frank case became a
              national cause. Northern newspapers, primarily
              <em>The&nbsp;New York Times</em> and <em>Collier’s Weekly</em>,
              argued Frank’s innocence amid nationwide expressions of
              anti-Semitism.
            </p>
            <p>
              This angered many Georgians, particularly Tom Watson, populist
              politician and publisher of
              <em>Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine</em>. When national
              publications attacked Georgia, Watson retaliated by disseminating
              sensational, anti-Semitic editorials that turned public opinion
              against Frank, and depicted the support of Frank’s appeals process
              as meddling from Northern and Jewish interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, Georgia governor John Slaton bore the responsibility
              for deciding whether Frank would hang or if his sentence would be
              commuted to life imprisonment. Slaton received letters urging
              commutation from Jim Conley’s attorney (who was convinced of his
              client’s guilt) and Judge Roan, who had presided over the Frank
              case. He also received letters against commutation, including one
              from a group of city leaders from Mary Phagan’s hometown of
              Marietta. Slaton agonized over the decision: he read trial
              documents, visited the crime scene, and ultimately commuted
              Frank’s sentence on his last day in office. Knowing the decision
              would be unpopular, Slaton left Georgia, and did not return for
              ten years.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the commutation, Frank was moved to the state prison farm
              near Milledgeville, Georgia.

                >The commutation of Leo Frank’s sentence by Governor Slaton in
                June of 1915 infuriated many Georgians. Publisher Tom Watson’s
                editorials inflamed public opinion, and circulation of his
                publications, including </span
              ><em>Watson’s Jeffersonian&nbsp;</em
              ><span><em>Magazine</em>,</span><span> more than tripled.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A group of Marietta, citizens, including a former governor, state
              judge, and several leading businessmen who had written and spoken
              publicly against Frank’s commutation, carefully organized,
              planned, and—it is believed—bribed or intimidated prison
              officials.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the evening of August 16, 1915, eight vehicles arrived at the
              state prison farm in Milledgeville. The group cut telephone lines,
              surprised guards, seized Frank, and returned to Marietta on back
              roads. One vehicle acted as a decoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching Marietta by dawn of August 17, 1915, Leo Frank was hanged
              from an oak tree in a grove not far from Mary Phagan’s home.
              Photographs were taken of his body hanging from the tree—they were
              later made into souvenirs. No one was ever prosecuted for the
              lynching.
            </p>

              <span
                ><span
                  >In the South during this period, Leo Frank’s lynching was
                  unusual because the majority of lynching victims were African
                  American men. These lynchings took many forms: spectacles with
                  giant crowds and secret violence perpetrated by night;
                  carefully planned attacks and more spontaneous murders; plans
                  developed by influential citizens and plots executed by large
                  mobs. Frank’s lynching was not necessarily unique in its
                  precise planning by important citizens and secret execution,
                  but it received more national attention than the thousands of
                  anonymous African American men lynched during the same period
                  because Frank was a Jew.

              The reaction in Georgia was different. Most white Georgians felt
              justice had been served.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>From the </span><em>Milledgeville Union-Recorder</em
              ><span
                >: “The real truth about the matter is about 90 per cent of the
                white people of Georgia believed Frank guilty, and believed that
                under the operation of the law his life was justly, legally, and
                righteously forfeited.”</span

            <p>
              <span
                >But there were also voices of opposition. Many saw the lynching
                as a manifestation of the intense anti-Semitism in the region
                exacerbated by Tom Watson’s writings in </span
              ><em>Watson’s Jeffersonian Magazine</em
              ><span>
                and similar publications. New South capitalists and elite
                Georgia progressives publicly disdained the vigilantism of the
                lynching, which they saw as a threat to the stability of
                industrialism and urban growth that they championed. And
                although African Americans were frustrated by the outburst of
                sympathy for Frank amidst white apathy to hundreds of African
                American lynchings, the African American press condemned the
                lynching as a familiar act of policing racial boundaries because
                Jews were considered a non-white racial group during this
                period.</span

            <p>Two whose careers advanced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Hugh Dorsey</strong>&nbsp;was relatively unknown before
                the trial. Before the Frank case, Dorsey had lost two highly
                publicized cases. But his victory in the Frank case propelled
                him upward. Dorsey was elected governor in 1916, and re-elected
                in 1918. Perhaps surprisingly, he was a progressive who openly
                campaigned against mob violence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tom Watson</strong><strong>:</strong> With his
                editorials on the Leo Frank case, circulation of Watson's
                Jeffersonian Magazine and The Jeffersonian increased
                dramatically. From this, Watson gained some wealth. Elected to
                the United States Senate in 1920, he died in office.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Two whose careers were damaged:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>John Slaton</strong><strong>,</strong> a popular
                governor and one-time favorite for a US Senate seat, saw his
                political career end with his commutation of Frank’s sentence.
                Threatened by mob violence, Slaton and his wife fled Georgia. He
                eventually returned, but never sought political office again.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>William Smith</strong><strong>,</strong> Jim Conley’s
                attorney, had misgivings about the sentencing of Frank. He had
                carefully studied the evidence, and concluded that his client,
                in fact, was guilty of Phagan’s murder. His letter to Governor
                Slaton was instrumental in the decision to commute Frank’s
                sentence. Unpopular because of this stance, he lost his legal
                clients, and later spent time working at shipyards in Virginia
                and New York.

                Atlanta Jews, who had worked hard to assimilate into Southern
                society since establishing themselves prior to the Civil War,
                were now convinced that they were not safe from anti-Semitism.
                Many withdrew from public life, and Jewish leaders were
                pressured to appear conciliatory so as not to arouse hostility.
                No Jewish candidates ran for public office in Atlanta for twenty
                years; some Jews felt it necessary to leave the South
                altogether.</span

                >By the mid-1940s, Atlanta’s Jewish leaders emerged with more
                outspoken views. Jacob Rothschild was rabbi at Atlanta’s oldest
                synagogue, the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation, also known as
                “the Temple.” Rothschild openly criticized segregation, and
                publicly supported the civil rights work of Martin Luther King,
                Jr. His outspokenness was challenged violently when the Temple
                was bombed by white supremacists in 1958. This time, however,
                Atlanta rallied to support its Jewish community. Led by Mayor
                William B. Hartsfield and </span

                unfair. These pieces angered many Georgians who resented the
                challenge of Southern courts by Northern journalists.</span

              The African American press also rejected white newspaper coverage
              of the Frank case. This came partly because the white press
              employed the same racist caricatures of Jim Conley that the Frank
              defense team had resorted to, and partly in exasperation that a
              white man’s lynching received so much more publicity than the
              lynchings of hundreds of African American men. &nbsp;

              In 1982, Frank’s former office boy, Alonzo Mann, signed an
              affidavit stating he saw Jim Conley carrying Mary Phagan’s body
              the day of her murder. Based upon this revelation, the
              Anti-Defamation League applied for a posthumous pardon for Frank
              from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The
              application was denied in a ruling that stated Mann’s testimony
              did not conclusively prove Frank’s innocence.

                  Frank. This pardon was granted in 1986. The pardon did not
                  address Frank’s guilt or innocence, only the state’s failure
                  to protect him.</span
