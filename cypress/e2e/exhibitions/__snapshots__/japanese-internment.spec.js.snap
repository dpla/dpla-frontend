          <p>
            On December 7, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked a US naval base at
            Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Pre-existing racial tensions and “yellow
            peril” hysteria magnified as the American public grew increasingly
            suspicious of Japanese Americans and uncertain of their loyalty.
            They were regarded as potential spies and anti-Japanese propaganda
            quickly spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
            issued Executive Order 9066. 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry
            (two-thirds of whom were US citizens) were forced to evacuate from
            their homes and report to assembly centers. From there, they were
            moved to one of ten internment camps, or War Relocation Centers,
            located in remote areas of seven states—California, Arizona,
            Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next three years, Japanese Americans acclimated to life
            behind barbed wire and under armed guard. Uprooted from their lives,
            they found themselves in strange and uncomfortable environments.
            They had to adapt to their new situation by adjusting to new living
            conditions, attending new schools, and finding inventive ways to
            pass the time. They attempted to maintain a sense of normalcy by
            attending religious meetings and by finding employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exhibition tells stories of everyday lives in Japanese
            Internment camps during World War II.

            <p>
              In the 1860s, a devastating recession in Japan sent thousands of
              men and women heading toward the United States in search of new
              jobs and opportunities. Of the approximately 200,000 who first
              relocated to Hawaii, nearly all later moved to the West Coast of
              the US mainland to do agricultural work and operate small
              businesses. A pact between Japan and the United States in 1908 put
              a ban on unskilled immigrant laborers, slowing the influx of
              Japanese men and women relocating. These first-generation Japanese
              immigrants (known as Issei) and their American-born children
              (known as Nisei) still thrived in the face of a climate of racism
              and distrust that permeated US culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the time of their arrival in the United States, Japanese
              immigrants, and other Asian immigrant groups, faced systematic
              discrimination from the American government and public. The
              Japanese and Korean Exclusion League (which later became the
              Asiatic Exclusion League) was established in May 1905. Other
              organizations followed, like the Anti-Jap Laundry League in 1908,
              which was formed by laundry worker unions with slogans asserting
              their need to maintain “the white man's standard in a white man's
              country” by boycotting Japanese-run laundries. Other
              organizations, like the Native Sons of the Golden West, would take
              anti-Japanese stances throughout the early 1900s, asserting that
              they needed to protect a California “given by God to a white
              people.” Legislation banned Japanese Americans from owning land or
              property, and laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the
              Immigration Act of 1924 banned "undesirable" immigration from
              Asian countries, including Japan.

            <p>
              At War Relocation Centers, administrators allowed families to live
              together but assigned them cramped, poorly equipped quarters. A
              1943 War Relocation Authority report describes internee housing as
              "tar paper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without
              plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind." Most of the camps
              were built quickly during the summer of 1942 and their design was
              based on military barracks. Throughout many camps, twenty-five
              people were forced to live in space built to contain four, which
              gave no privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Family apartments were typically single twenty by twenty-four foot
              rooms with external bathrooms, showers, and laundry shared by a
              larger group. These rooms had little insulation save wood stoves
              in cold weather, and poor ventilation in the heat. In such close
              quarters, diseases like typhoid, dysentery, and smallpox spread
              quickly across the camp and forced understaffed and undersupplied
              medical centers to put most of their resources toward
              vaccinations. High incidence of food poisoning and other illnesses
              also contributed to unsanitary conditions in shared bathroom
              facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though families attempted to cope with their situation, when later
              surveyed about their experiences, “living conditions” was the
              number one response to the question asking what the most difficult
              part of the experience was.

                >Education was an essential component of life in internment
                camps, and a concern for parents who saw it as a path for social
                advancement. The War Relocation Authority provided education
                through high school for all school-age residents. However, camp
                school houses were crowded, with a student-teacher ratio of up
                to 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools.
                This rating was high, particularly when compared to the national
                average of 28:1. Educational staff rarely exceeded five women
                and seven men in a basic school system that enrolled 1,774
                pupils.</span

                  numerous children detained there. Often entire blocks of
                  barracks were converted for grade school classrooms, but they
                  were ‘prison-esque’ blocks that contained few windows. When
                  temperatures rose and the schoolhouse was filled, the rooms
                  would be sweltering and unbearable. The makeshift schoolhouses
                  were never intended for long-term use. And without adequate
                  funding, school supplies and equipment were always in short

              Employment at the camps was not mandatory, but most adult
              internees chose to work. Not only was it a way for them to pass
              the time and to earn a wage, but also internee employment was
              necessary for the everyday operations of the camps. The majority
              worked full-time, usually around forty-four hours per week. At
              first, internees were not paid for their work, but this later
              changed. Rates of pay varied depending on the type of work
              performed and the skill of the worker. For instance, professional
              and technical work would earn sixteen dollars per month, a
              mid-range rate was twelve dollars per month for skilled work, and
              the lowest rate was eight dollars per month for unskilled work. As
              an added benefit, internees who worked were given a clothing
              credit of $3.75 month.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before life in the camps, Japanese Americans made much more money
              than they did while interned. They also made significantly less
              than their Caucasian counterparts who staffed the camps. For
              example, internee teachers at Heart Mountain Relocation Center
              were paid $228 per year while base salaries for Caucasian
              instructors set at $2,000 per year.

                included typical worship spaces such as churches. Much of the
                photographic documentation of Japanese internment camps focuses
                on Christian facilities for religious practice. Multiple
                Christian denominations were prominent in the interned
                communities, as well as more traditional Buddhist practices like
                Shintoism. Since camp administrators could not enforce the
                religious needs of internees, both religions flourished in the
                camps.</span

                  multifunctional. Buildings differed in size and quality, and
                  often served multiple purposes. Regardless of the space’s
                  condition, camp religious centers provided community,
                  education, and even amenities. Christian-run organizations
                  often took responsibility for providing equipment, serving
                  social needs, and organizing camp-wide activities and
                  festivities. Camp religious spaces served not only as
                  important physical places, they also played a vital
                  psychological role as safe spaces for internees.</span

                >President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which began and
                legalized the process of Japanese internment, was unofficially
                rescinded in December 1944, less than a year before World War II
                ended. Soon after, the </span

              ><span>
                began a six-month resettlement process that released internees
                into temporary housing. By 1946, all of the camps that forcibly
                held Japanese Americans were closed.</span

                however, was that the lives they left were no longer available
                to them. Workers lost their jobs during deportation, and
                families had lost their homes and property to opportunists who
                had seized them in their absence. It would be another thirty
                years before the men and women who survived internment were
                offered any formal apology by the United States
                government.</span

                >During the "Redress Movement" of the 1960s and 70s, Japanese
                internment once again gained national attention. Thanks to the
                activism of many young Japanese Americans, President Gerald Ford
                officially rescinded Roosevelt’s Executive Order in 1976,
                calling internment a "national mistake."</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Four years later, Congress established the Commission on
                Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which studied
                Japanese internment and held hearings across the country. Their
                findings, called </span
              ><em>Personal Justice Denied</em

                >, described internment as &nbsp;a "grave injustice" rooted in
                prejudice. The Civil Liberties Act in 1988 later issued $20,000
                to each surviving internee as a redress for their
                experiences.</span

            <p>
              Though there was already an established culture of discrimination
              against Asian immigrant groups, anti-Japanese sentiment gained
              momentum after the events of December 7, 1941—Pearl Harbor. On
              this “date which will live in infamy,” the Imperial Japanese Navy
              attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This
              surprise attack further motivated the US government to officially
              enter World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day after Pearl Harbor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
              began arresting Japanese men—many of whom were leaders in their
              communities—who had been placed on a Department of Justice watch
              list. Within forty-eight hours, over a thousand Japanese men were
              taken into custody and jailed. Just as swiftly, the US Government
              began to distribute xenophobic war propaganda that placed the
              Japanese at the top of America’s list of enemies. Using offensive
              racial stereotypes, this propaganda (which permeated American
              media throughout the war) was used to alienate and vilify the
              Japanese as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Japanese American loyalty soon became a core issue for President
              Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. Many Japanese men and
              women were even forced to take loyalty tests that included
              questions about their belief in Japanese culture and their
              allegiance to the United States. These loyalty tests included
              scenarios that asked what the test-taker would do if he or she had
              suspicions about a hypothetical neighbor and requests for
              references to “vouch for your conduct.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Western Defense Command general, General John L. DeWitt,
              classified Japanese and Japanese Americans alike as “an enemy
              race,” and soon changes to their civil rights reflected that. It
              would be the only moment in US history when the federal government
              effectively nullified citizenship on grounds of racial difference.

            <p>
              Issued only two months after Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt’s
              Executive Order 9066 authorized the forced evacuation and
              relocation of any person in undefined “military areas.” This
              order, premised on the assumption that all people of Japanese
              heritage were potential spies, moved Japanese Americans from more
              “dangerous” West Coast areas to remote locations in the country’s
              interior. Its logic dictated that when Japanese Americans were
              kept under surveillance, restricted from using traditional
              communication, and physically removed from bustling coastal cities
              that were geographically closer to Japan, they were less capable
              of assisting in another attack on US shores.
            </p>
            <p>
              In just a few months, Japanese American families on the West Coast
              were forced to leave their homes behind and begin the long process
              of deportation. First came curfews and then bulletins posted in
              public areas informing them when residents from particular areas
              should report for evacuation and instructing them to bring only
              bedding, clothing, and personal effects. From March through May
              1942, Japanese Americans were quickly assembled and removed from
              areas in Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington, where they
              owned property, attended schools, and had built communities for
              decades. Families were forced to abandon their homes, pets,
              furniture, and other items that would not make the journey with
              them. Japanese deportation and incarceration was supported by many
              white farmers who resented Japanese American farmers. Even more
              sympathetic neighbors and teachers did little to stop the removal
              of the Japanese Americans who lived among them.

            <p>
              After leaving their homes, many Japanese Americans were initially
              sent to temporary assembly centers that were hastily organized and
              poorly arranged. These living quarters were primitive and
              resembled military barracks. Many had previously served as
              racetracks and fairgrounds and retained the smells and physical
              evidence of animal life.
            </p>
            <p>
              A former prisoner recalls the temporary quarters as sheds, with
              partitions dividing the sections that did not reach the ceiling.
              If anyone made noise during the night, as often happened with
              young children, it disturbed everyone. The toilet facilities were
              described as a pit with boards, the stench was overwhelming and
              sanitation was poor. Preparations were not made to properly
              accommodate the prisoners. These centers were a radical transition
              from the comfortable homes internees had left days before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the summer of 1942, evacuees were sent by train from
              assembly centers to ten War Relocation Centers in undesirable
              areas in the interior: Minidoka (Idaho), Heart Mountain (Wyoming),
              Manzanar (California), Tule Lake (California), Granada (Colorado),
              Topaz (Utah), Gila River (Arizona), Poston (Arizona), Rohwer
              (Arkansas), and Jerome (Arkansas). As they traveled by train, they
              saw their familiar landscapes give way to the harsh climates of
              desolate mountains, deserts, and swamps. Approaching the camps,
              they saw that their new homes were surrounded by barbed wire and
              armed guards in towers. As the train pulled in, internees were
              confronted with the full extent of their new isolation.

            <p>
              Before the war, family was the key social unit for Japanese
              Americans. Incarceration in the camps greatly affected family
              dynamics and placed new pressures on family units. Men were
              traditionally the patriarchal leaders of the family, running small
              businesses or farms, and this authority was eroded by life in the
              camps, causing a disruption in deeply ingrained familial roles,
              relationships, and identities. More broadly, social networks that
              developed before mass incarceration were splintered, as neighbors,
              friends, and coworkers were sent to different relocation centers.
              The break-up of these informal social infrastructures is one of
              many little-perceived and long-term hardships that internment had
              on family and social life for Japanese Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tensions between first (Issei) and second (Nisei) generations
              within families were exacerbated by the incarceration. And, the
              work of organizations like the Japanese American Citizens League
              (JACL), which collaborated with federal authorities to identify
              disloyalty, added to the feelings of disconnectedness. The JACL
              encouraged Nisei children to rebel against their Issei parents by
              offering patriotic, Americanized activities. These generational
              tensions were further aggravated in 1943 by government pressure on
              Nisei to enlist in the US military and adults to complete a
              loyalty questionnaire that demanded that Japanese Americans
              renounce their connections to Japan. People who refused to take
              the questionnaire—or “failed”—were relocated with their families
              to the Tule Lake Segregation Center—a special camp for internees
              deemed especially politically dangerous. Differing attitudes
              towards loyalty, tradition, enlistment, and the questionnaire tore
              many Japanese American families apart.

            <p>
              The disruption in familial roles and structure had a significant
              impact on the lives of Japanese American women. Japanese families
              were typically patriarchal in structure, and this changed under
              internment. When men were no longer the economic centers of the
              household, the traditional identities of men and women were
              reconfigured, along with the long-established gendered division of
              labor. Marriage and childbearing were also delayed by separation
              and other circumstances, which changed the timeline of
              independence for single women.
            </p>
            <p>
              A former prisoner whose father was taken away recalls the impact
              it had on her sister and mother. Her sister went from being a
              pampered child to the head of the household. These kinds of
              transitions gave women greater power within the family unit and
              children adult responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the difficulties of familial upheaval and the
              dehumanization of imprisonment, there were long-term changes in
              the lives of Japanese American women that some see as ultimately
              advantageous. Small living spaces and collectivization of tasks
              such as meal preparation, laundry, and child care, lessened
              women’s domestic duties. In some ways these were positive changes
              for women, freeing up young women for education, and older women
              for wage-earning positions. But greater power sometimes came at a
              cost: separation from beloved male family members or the loss of a
              care-free childhood.

                crew of teachers ran camp schools, prepared handwritten
                instructional materials, and often held classes outside because
                of overcrowding and lack of school building ventilation. It was
                not unusual for schools to be staffed by both Japanese and
                Caucasian teachers. Caucasian teachers were expected to live
                year-round in the camps and work a longer week to accommodate a
                larger class size.</span

              <span

                secondary schools, which gave them the freedom to design their
                own curricula in math, science, English, and social
                studies—within limits. The War Relocation Authority requested
                that Americanization classes be a part of the camp schooling.
                These classes focused on indoctrinating the younger generation
                of Japanese Americans with “American” values that would ensure
                their loyalty and best prepare them for an assimilated life
                after the war.</span

                  >Learning and respecting teachers were integral parts of
                  Japanese culture. Students wore clean uniforms despite their
                  living situations. The community school philosophy was
                  designed to benefit each student as well as the community
                  because education was perceived as a tool with which to
                  improve a student’s quality of life. In camp schools, students
                  gained specific skills for future employment, as well as an
                  understanding of traditional academic concepts like the
                  scientific method and newly emphasized democratic
                  principles.</span

                >Although educational programs and standards of living varied
                between camps, Japanese internees developed universal outlets
                for dealing with depression and the monotony of camp life.
                Sports, especially baseball, united camp residents and drew
                large crowds eager to recapture a small part of their pre-war
                lives. High school and community teams played against each
                other, as well as against non-camp teams. Camp newspapers
                devoted full pages to sports scores, which internees followed
                religiously. At the Topaz Camp, men over 50 years-old played
                against a girls’ softball team. Camp guards also participated in
                the games. Photographer Ansel Adams, who was determined to
                discover how “these human beings suffering under great injustice
                overcame a sense of despair and defeat,” found that the key was
                baseball.</span

                  >Once baseball season ended in October, internees turned to
                  fall sports like football. Teams consisted of six to seven men
                  and the intensity varied from camp to camp. A few college-age
                  Nisei (American-born Japanese) transferred to colleges outside
                  the camp to play collegiate football. Among them was Chester
                  (Chet) Maeda who was drafted by the Detroit Lions in
                  1943.</span

                police department, and fire department. Evacuee dentists,
                doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff worked under Caucasian
                directors. Since school was mandatory, internee teachers were
                employed, although they earned considerably less than their
                Caucasian counterparts.

                >Each camp had its own newspaper, meaning that journalists,
                typesetters, illustrators, and paper boys all had job
                opportunities. Each camp also had dry goods stores that employed
                cashiers and sales representatives. There was an especially
                great need for mess hall workers and cooks to provide the camp
                residents with three daily meals. Office work that supported the
                administration of the camps was an option for many. Construction
                projects were always ongoing, requiring the hands of many
                carpenters. Sanitation workers had the unforgiving, but
                necessary, task of tending to the latrines.</span

                perform seasonal farm work. Sugar beet crops in the western part

                religious lives of many camp internees. Missionaries had been
                building relationships with Japanese immigrant communities since
                the first Japanese immigrants arrived on US soil. Religious
                schools indoctrinated Japanese American children starting in day
                care services and exerting influence over a student's entire
                primary education. During World War II, religious organizations
                advocated for fairer treatment of Japanese Americans, while
                working to Americanize them through religious indoctrination. In
                some instances, religious teachers followed their parishes into
                the camps to continue their religious instruction.

                incarceration was often complicated. Some Japanese Americans
                identified as Christian superficially before entering the camps
                in response to sociocultural pressure. Others turned more fully
                to Christianity for other reasons, ranging from the desire to
                identify with the American majority to true philosophical and
                religious conversion.

                >The religious identity of many Japanese Americans during the
                time of internment and relocation was often tied to Buddhist
                traditions. Some internees identified as Buddhist in name only,
                not through action or ritual, while others were more devout in
                their practice. Even for less religious Japanese Americans in
                the camps, Buddhist ideas influenced traditional Japanese
                culture. Some internees identified as Christian while
                interweaving Buddhist traditions into daily life. These multiple
                religious and cultural influences created a blended and diverse
                approach to &nbsp;worship and heritage in the camps. Alongside
                Christian worship, Buddhist religious practices
                flourished.</span

              <span
                >Some historians theorize that this period of harsh
                discrimination strengthened traditional beliefs and practices
                for Japanese Americans. In some of the camps, this trend was
                evidenced by a surge in interest in and practice of Buddhism.
                Renewed attention to Buddhism, as well as Japanese cultural
                rituals more broadly, was part of the way that internees
                resisted the full Americanization and loyalty pressures imposed
                on them in the camps. Resistance was manifest in traditional
                gardens and Shinto shrines found in areas of the camps. For
                some, creating these tranquil and reverent outdoor spaces was an
                extension of longstanding aesthetics that drew upon their shared
                cultural heritage. For others, it was an act of quiet
                rebellion.</span
