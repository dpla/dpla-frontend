              >Since European explorers first arrived in the Americas, the
              pursuit of gold has been one of the driving forces behind
              colonization and migration in the New World. Despite the hopes of
              early European colonizers, gold remained elusive in the eastern
              settlements of the thirteen colonies and tobacco prevailed as the
              sustaining economic export. After gaining its independence from
              England, the United States struggled to develop a national sense
              of identity that would unite its economically diverse colonies.
              With independence, it became legal to allow settlement west of the
              Appalachian Mountains, previously the general border of European
              settlement. As the newly formed America consolidated its hold on
              more and more “available” land, purchasing the Louisiana Territory
              from France and establishing a solid border with British-held
              Canada in the Oregon Territory and northern Maine, westward
              expansion became an integral part of what it meant to be American.
              The idea of Manifest Destiny began to take hold. American citizens
              began to believe and to preach that it was their God-given right
              and duty to take over the entire continent, to take control of the
              land from the Native Americans, who white Americans believed did
              not understand or practice correct land stewardship and therefore
              did not deserve to retain their ancestral homes. It was during
              this period of nationalistic expansion that gold was first
              discovered in 1848 at Sutter’s Mill in present-day
              California.</span

              >This exhibition explores the Gold Rush—a group of related gold
              rushes to Western territories in the second half of the nineteenth
              century—and its impact on American history and culture. Catalyzed
              by the discovery of gold the Sierra Nevada in 1848, gold fever
              would persist for decades, attracting migrants looking to stake
              their claims to increasingly northern and eastern
              destinations—from the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado,
              Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to the Yukon Territory and present-day
              Alaska by the 1890s. &nbsp;</span

                >The discovery of gold in California came at a time when the
                United States government was searching for ways to assert its
                identity as a nation. Expansion was already happening at a
                breakneck pace, with canals from upstate New York to the Great
                Lakes region opening up the interior of the country to trade and
                settlement by whites. The Oregon question was resolved in 1848
                when the Oregon Territory was legally recognized as a possession
                of the United States, solidifying the country’s reach into the
                Pacific Northwest. The Mexican-American War had ended in 1848 as
                well, with Mexico ceding most of California as well as Arizona,
                Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado to the United States. Now a
                burgeoning nation with widespread territory holdings, the United
                States needed to settle these holdings with citizens to maintain
                its claims. How better to do that than with the promise of
                gold?</span

                  >Advertisements from the period emphasize the idealistic
                  purity of the country, portraying the west as a vast expanse
                  of unclaimed land ripe for the taking. Readers are assured
                  that life out west will be far easier than the drudgery of
                  farm life on the crowded east coast—recently arrived
                  immigrants will find gold ready to be plucked from the ground
                  or the water, fertile land begging to be tilled and planted,
                  and a temperate wilderness empty of human habitation and ready
                  to be civilized by white Americans. Songs and art exhibits
                  extolled the virtues of the west and those who journeyed out
                  to tame it, conveniently ignoring the hardships immigrants
                  would face and the indigenous peoples already occupying land
                  that was supposedly freely available.</span

                >The boom era of the Gold Rush coincided with the development of
                photography as a journalistic and documentarian tool in
                America—circumstances which gave rise to a wealth of
                photographic evidence about the experience of the miners in the
                gold fields. The photographs themselves are powerful propaganda,
                depicting American men robustly taming the wilderness and
                American families carving niches of civilization amidst forests
                and deserts. But they are also testimonials to the actual
                day-to-day struggles of those who went west in search of
                gold—the hard work, the freezing winters and blazing summers,
                the physical danger, and the isolation, not to mention the fact
                that very few miners actually struck it rich in the gold fields.
                From miners packing up their possessions and leaving their homes

            <p>
              The pervasive view of the Gold Rush in American culture imagines
              fevered years of U.S. population settlement in the West and the
              rise of a frontier masculinity that transformed America’s national
              identity. This singular portrait is based largely on photographs
              and records like those seen so far in this exhibition—pictures of
              rugged American men taming the frontier, gentle American women
              mothering children in a lawless land, and white American citizens
              bringing their superior way of life to the misguided, primitive
              inhabitants of the Western wilderness. The reality was quite
              different, and while there is far less evidence of the
              marginalized participants in the gold rushes, photographs and
              documents do exist that attest to their presence and influence on
              the frontier culture that developed over decades of American
              expansion into the West.

                >Although the gold rushes of the 19th and early 20th century
                were by all measurements immensely important events—events that
                changed America’s international identity, national culture and
                the very shape of its land—they did not that make the hundreds
                of thousands of hopefuls who journeyed to the gold fields rich
                beyond their wildest dreams. Instead, the gold rushes helped
                pave the way for a new America—a country whose territory
                stretched from coast to coast, whose morals were a curious mix
                of frontier individualism and old world propriety, whose
                economic and social influence over the world would continue to
                grow for over a century, and whose relationship with race,
                gender, class, and national origin formed a tangled web, still
                being unknotted today.</span

                  >The gold rushes had a profound and lasting impact on U.S.
                  geography as well. They catalyzed massive population
                  migrations which brought government and commerce that
                  transformed expansive territories into new, bounded U.S.
                  states in the West like California (1850) and Idaho (1890),
                  and tiny settlements into large American cities like San
                  Francisco and Denver. &nbsp;Although the earliest groups of
                  gold rush migrants traveled by steamship and overland,
                  migration to the West and related economic needs spurred the
                  growth of railroads connecting the U.S. coasts, culminating in
                  the creation of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. The new
                  railroad bridged the gap between east and west and opened up
                  unpopulated areas in the country’s interior for development,
                  settlement, and exploration, following the paths paved by the
                  gold rush migrants.</span

                  >The initial discovery of gold in California in 1848 was a
                  defining moment, not only for America but also for the world.
                  As the word spread, people from far-flung nations were as
                  eager to abandon their lives in search of treasure, as were
                  people from the cramped east coast of the United States. A
                  special term emerged—those who rushed to California upon
                  receiving news of gold discovery were called “forty-niners.”
                  South Americans sailed up the west coast of the continent or
                  around Cape Horn, braving one of the most hazardous stretches
                  of ocean on earth. Emigrants from China and the Philippines
                  made their way across the Pacific, and the sailors who worked
                  the ships were entranced by word of gold, abandoning their
                  ships in San Francisco’s harbor for the elusive promise of
                  fortune. Europeans journeyed by train and ship and wagon
                  across the vast expanse of prairie in the center of the
                  continent. They joined the American migrants from the east
                  coast as they made their way along the recently established
                  Oregon Trail and detoured southwest somewhere in what would
                  become Wyoming, crossing deserts and mountains and risking
                  life and limb in pursuit of the promised gold. This pattern
                  would continue with future gold strikes—word spread around the
                  world, luring anyone who dreamt of improving their condition
                  to follow the trail toward the possibility of striking it
                  rich.</span

              While uncommon, a few of the men mining claims or creeks actually
              struck it rich, especially in the early days of the gold rushes.
              But for most of the men who traveled to California, Nevada,
              Alaska, and the other gold fields, the work was hard and the
              reward small. Men stood in freezing creeks for hours every day,
              panning through the water in search of tiny flakes of gold.
              &nbsp;Tunnels were drilled or dug into mountains at great risk to
              the miners, and digging took place in horrifying physical
              conditions. Disputes between rival claimants also led to violence
              that claimed lives, often in the generally lawless boomtowns that
              sprang up around reported discoveries of gold. The belief was that
              the gold, freely available to whoever could get ahold of it first,
              was the ultimate signifier of the American dream—that these miners
              were seizing for themselves their unalienable right to life,
              liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In reality, their painful
              drudgery was rarely rewarded, and the miners who were partially
              responsible for the expansion of America and taming of the West
              often abandoned their dreams of easy riches for the taking, or
              followed them fruitlessly from gold rush to gold rush until they
              were no longer able to take part in the grueling work.

                  >Around the big strikes, boomtowns sprang up—hastily
                  established settlements of miners populated largely by men who
                  abandoned prevailing Victorian social customs, law, and order.
                  Occupants of these towns mixed classes and races in ways that
                  very rarely happened in older established cities. Native
                  Americans, Asian and European immigrants, and American
                  citizens interacted with each other on a daily basis,
                  lubricated by the giddy promise of wealth and, often, copious
                  amounts of alcohol. The relative absence of women led men to
                  feel entitled to behave differently than they would have in
                  “polite society”—most women in the towns were prostitutes or
                  Native or immigrant women who belonged to classes that were
                  not afforded the same respect as the middle-class white women
                  many of these men had left behind. Violence was disturbingly
                  common; boomtowns had incredibly high rates of homicide during
                  their relatively short existences. Conveniences were
                  incredibly expensive, as retailers used lack of supply,
                  difficulty of access, and high demand to charge exorbitant
                  prices for basic foodstuffs or clothing. At smaller mining
                  claims, life was even rougher—often the miner and his family
                  (if they were with him) lived in quickly constructed shacks in
                  the wilderness miles from neighbors and were forced to fend
                  for themselves. Personal accounts from the time outline the
                  severe hardships miners and boomtown inhabitants faced in
                  their quest for gold.</span

                  >After all the hard work, sweat, and blood poured into the
                  land, the returns were more often than not disappointing for
                  the miners who had journeyed to the gold fields. Quickly
                  depleted claims, fast-moving mining companies buying up the
                  rights to strikes and employing miners at a pittance, and
                  sky-high prices of necessities in the boomtowns meant that the
                  average miner of any gold strike was unlikely to make a
                  significant profit. Instead, those who saw the strikes as
                  opportunities to invest or ply their trades were usually the
                  ones who came away wealthier. Grocers and shopkeepers who sold
                  basic food staples at an incredible mark-up made a killing
                  from miners who lived without women around to do household
                  chores like tend a garden or bake bread. Gambling den owners
                  and good-time girls siphoned money from men flush from a
                  recent find and eager for a good time on the lawless frontier.
                  Mining companies and banks who corporatized the gold mining
                  process by hiring miners to work for them and skimming profits
                  off all the gold brought in to be weighed, would come away
                  from any gold rush far richer than the men who dug and panned
                  for the shiny rocks or dust in the water.

                >The white world of the American West at the beginning of the
                California Gold Rush was overwhelmingly male, with estimates
                that for every woman in the territory there were over twelve
                men. Although this number gradually balanced out through the
                1850s, and subsequent gold rushes such as the Klondike Rush in
                Alaska were never quite as segregated, women were seen as
                “other” in the West well into the 20th century. While many women
                capitalized on new, looser social mores to make their own
                destiny by working in the mines or operating businesses they
                could never have owned alone back east, most of the women who
                eventually made their way west did so as helpmeets to the men
                and symbols of a return to social order. A woman in the West
                could earn her husband a lot of money with her homemaking skills
                like laundry or baking, and men saw marriage as not only a
                necessary emotional or physical contract but also a good
                economic investment. As large numbers of women arrived in
                boomtowns, they formed groups very similar to those that existed
                back East, such as temperance societies and church social
                groups, and worked to tone down the social behaviors of rowdy
                miners. Prostitutes, who for a time were the most numerous
                female group in the West, were the one exception to this trend.
                By 1850, San Francisco alone had over 2,000 prostitutes, some of
                whom were elite and mixed with the city’s burgeoning high
                society, but most of whom were simply good-time girls, providing
                sexual favors to lonely and often violent miners in small tents
                or shacks for meager earnings. While the West was symbolic of
                opportunity and frontiers for many who travelled there,
                including thousands of white women, it was also bound by the
                morals of its time. Women were accorded many new freedoms as
                long as they agreed to abide by the existing social
                contract.</span

                >People came from all over the world to mine for gold in the
                American West. The migration from the east coast out to
                California in 1849 was one of the largest mass migrations in
                American history in which American migrants were joined by
                hopeful miners from Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America as
                word of gold spread. The location of gold deposits on the west
                coast particularly spurred large waves of Asian immigration,
                especially from China and the Philippines. Multiple communities
                based on shared national origin and culture developed around
                gold strikes.</span

                  >But the west coast’s huge variety of ethnicities did not mean
                  it was free of the prejudices that dictated life in the rest
                  of the country. Immigrants were second-class citizens at
                  best—and that was a status reserved for those who looked and
                  spoke as much like white American-born citizens as possible.
                  Asian and South American immigrants, as well as those
                  Spanish-speaking Californios who had lived in the area since
                  before California belonged to the United States, were
                  relegated to the lowest classes of society. White men often
                  superseded claims they made upon gold deposits, for even if
                  the immigrant had discovered the gold first the white man had
                  the weight of the law behind him. Violence was endemic to the
                  mining communities, and more often than not was directed at
                  racial minorities by white men, and assault was seen as
                  completely within the legal rights of the white assailants.
                  Early on, taxes were enacted that specifically targeted
                  immigrants, and white miners often took advantage of new
                  residents who spoke little English to con them out of more
                  money than they already owed. Although mining towns allowed
                  for more interaction between ethnic and racial groups than was
                  usually possible in America’s more “civilized” areas, the
                  mores and thinking of the times continued to allow white
                  miners and those who could pass as white to maintain higher
                  social standing than immigrants of color, and these traditions
                  were generally enforced by an unchallenged, racist legal
                  system.</span

              If immigrants were second-class citizens to the white American
              miners who flooded the West starting in the 1840s, then the native
              inhabitants of the land were barely considered human, worthy of
              extermination without a second thought. Starting in 1850 in
              California, Native Americans could be indentured indefinitely for
              “vagrancy” by law and enslaved by white miners and ranchers for up
              to fifteen years. Native men were often slaughtered if they were
              not put to work, and women and children were kidnapped and used as
              cheap labor or for sexual gratification. The natural resources
              that various tribes had relied on for centuries were decimated in
              months, leading to death by starvation for thousands who had
              managed to escape murder or slavery. Massacres of entire villages
              were commonplace throughout the American West and were reported in
              newspapers as sport, often with morbid headlines “Good Haul of
              Diggers.” Tribes throughout the West were annihilated in
              incredibly short stretches of time, and for those who managed to
              survive the bloodbath, the future was bleak. Seen as animals with
              no morals, sense of ownership of the land, or reason for
              existence, the Native inhabitants of the American West were
              violent casualties of the new American idea of Manifest Destiny.
              God’s plan for white American expansion left no room for the
              original inhabitants of the land.
