              understood as a time of innocence, learning, and play. At the end
              of the nineteenth century, however, children made up part of the
              country’s workforce, and labored on farms and in factories. When
              they were not working, they enjoyed great independence in leisure

              legislation, they sought to define what a happy and healthy
              childhood should be in the modern age. Immersion in nature was
              central to what the Progressives prescribed, and children’s
              organizations and camps offered a suitable combination of
              supervision and open spaces.</span

              postwar America. Children were given a distinct place in the

              emergence of teenage culture and buying power.</span

                >The American Industrial Revolution during the second half of
                the nineteenth century created ample demand for low-skill jobs.
                Income disparity was rampant, especially in the crowded cities
                of the Northeast, and children were expected to contribute to
                their family’s household income. Factory work for children was
                not isolated in the urban North, however. Children worked, often
                alongside their parents, in the glass factories of Pennsylvania
                and West Virginia, textile mills of the South, and oyster
                canneries of the Gulf Coast.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>In fact, positions existed specifically for children</span
              ><span>—</span
              ><span
                >tasks which were designed to take advantage of their small size
                or to compensate for it. Coal mines employed children to work in
                the coal breaker, an area outside of the mine where coal was
                sorted and graded. Known as “breaker boys,” these children would
                work for ten to twelve hours a day separating slate from
                coal.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >Factory and mine work kept children out of school and also put
                them at great physical risk. The long hours and physical demands
                of monotonous manufacturing work threatened to impair children’s
                development, as did the hazardous environment that they labored
                in. Spinning machinery, exceedingly high temperatures, and toxic
                fumes were common features of mills and factories.</span

              The Progressive Era was a period of social and political reform
              that took place in the United States from the 1890s to the 1920s.
              Legislation of this era sought to correct social problems caused
              by rapid industrialization in the second half of the nineteenth
              century. &nbsp;The Progressives of this period were also focused
              on the elimination of the political corruption of the party bosses
              and political machines of the Gilded Age. Social reformers such as
              Jane Addams and W. E. B. DuBois argued that education and
              intervention could improve the lives of the underprivileged, while
              muckrakers such as Jacob Riis and Ida Tarbell published works
              designed to enlighten those who lived a comfortable distance from
              slums of Chicago or the boardrooms of the Standard Oil Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              The era saw a wide range of reformers associated with many
              different issues, such as compulsory public education, civil
              rights, temperance, women’s suffrage, local government
              reorganization, birth control, trust busting, and child labor, to
              name a few. With an ever-growing immigrant population, a widening
              economic divide, and a lack of social programs, “child saving” was
              a mandate that the Progressives could agree upon.

              Children and adults alike suffered from illness and disease in the
              late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Communicable
              diseases were caught and spread easily due to harsh living
              conditions, poor nutrition, and lack of sanitation. Cholera,
              typhus, polio, and tuberculosis were all prevalent. &nbsp;A lack
              of health education in both rural and urban communities also
              contributed to the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maternal and infant health was of great concern to public health
              workers. With a lack of health services and proper sanitation,
              pregnant mothers and infants of the working poor were at risk for
              disease and infection, especially in the summer because of
              dehydration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early public health initiatives sought to prevent childhood
              disease, especially among the urban poor. Lillian Wald, a pioneer
              of public health, founded the Henry Street Settlement in 1893 in
              the immigrant-populated Lower East Side neighborhood of New York
              City. The organization provided much-needed health and social
              services for the neighborhood, including maternity and infant
              care. A strong advocate for child welfare, Wald helped to found
              the National Organization for Public Health Nursing and the Child
              Labor Committee, which later became the National Child Labor
              Committee.

            <h2>Rural Children: Life Outdoors</h2>
            <p>
              To many adults in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth
              century, rural and farm communities were the ideal setting for a
              happy and healthy childhood. Progressives in particular held the
              view that fresh air, natural settings, and open spaces for play
              and adventure fostered physical and intellectual development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children raised on farms spent most of their time outdoors and
              enjoyed leisure activities in nature: trapping, hunting, fishing,
              swimming, and sledding. Progressives were concerned, however, that
              between field work and chores, farm children had little time for
              play. Reformers felt that their isolation from other children
              created an “emptiness of life,” according to a report from the
              1930 White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. As
              Progressives increasingly embraced the idea of organized and
              supervised play, no one, they felt, was more in need of this than
              the farm child. &nbsp;

            <h2>4-H</h2>
            <p>
              For many rural children in the late nineteenth century and early
              twentieth century, life could be lonely. A neighboring farm might
              be hours away, and play time was limited anyway because of work
              and chores. Many youths answered the call of newly industrialized
              cities, where they moved to work once they came of age.
              Recognizing a need among rural children for social organizations
              that also instilled an appreciation for rural life, agricultural
              clubs were born. Established as a national organization known as
              4-H in 1914, these clubs operated in several states, and sought to
              create a youth movement in agriculture. In particular, 4-H hoped
              to harness young people's willingness to experiment with new
              technology, which adult farmers had been hesitant to do. Camping
              was a major feature of the organization—a social benefit to farm
              children who may have otherwise been isolated from other children,
              especially in the summertime.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organization satisfied the concerns of Progressives because it
              fostered a relationship with nature within an organized and
              instructional setting—a feature of play advocated by the
              playground reformers. Furthermore, a child who joined 4-H was
              signing up to participate in activities that were strictly for
              fun: a luxury that many farm children, busy with chores, lacked.
              By the mid-twentieth century, 4-H clubs had sprung up in high
              schools around the country.

              <span
                >In the economic boom of the post World War II-era, housing was
                in high demand. Through a provision of the Serviceman’s
                Readjustment Act, a mortgage program provided for returning
                soldiers in 1944. People were eager to buy homes and settle
                down, away from crowded cities that afforded little space for
                their children to play. Enterprising developers went to work
                building spaces that could specifically accommodate
                families.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Dr. Spock’s bestselling book on parenting, </span
              ><em>The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</em
              ><span
                >, implored parents towards a more empathetic style of
                parenting, through which children’s needs were listened to and
                understood. Rigid schedules and firm rules for children were
                slowly discarded, and children occupied a more empowered
                position in postwar families. The suburban homes that many
                families lived in reflected this, with designated playrooms and
                spacious yards.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >However, the safe parks and new schools that so attracted
                families were not enjoyed by all in the postwar period.
                Facilities were racially segregated throughout the South, and
                African American children might be educated in
                <span>dilapidated</span>&nbsp;army barracks, while their white
                peers learned in a new and spacious school building.</span

            <p>
              In the last decades of the nineteenth century, many families lived
              in rural communities and farmed for their livelihood. Living off
              of the land required a tremendous amount of labor, especially in
              the raw frontier environments of the American West. Families
              needed every member to contribute. The demands of farm work
              competed with children’s availability for school and even leisure
              activities. By 1900, the average child was spending more time
              working in the fields than attending school.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decades later, work was still a major part of life for farmers'
              children, for advancements in agricultural technology did not
              release children from their day-to-day chores. Like their parents
              and grandparents, children in the 1920s and 1930s were expected to
              help work the fields, tend to the animals, clear land, plant
              crops, weed, and harvest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children were also expected to perform domestic labor such as
              washing clothes, fetching water, and cooking meals. Often, there
              lacked a traditional division between boys’ and girls’ roles, with
              boys performing some domestic duties and, even more frequently,
              girls doing the traditional field and farm work of men.

              In the first few decades of the twentieth century, many urban poor
              and working-class children worked in the “street trades,” selling
              newspapers and magazines, shining shoes, making deliveries, and
              distributing advertisements. A 1928 report by the Children’s
              Bureau estimated that there were 40,000 newspaper boys working in
              cities with an average age of twelve years old. Newspaper hours
              could be longer than the ten to twelve hour days endured by
              children working in factories, as the boys would line the streets
              at 5:00 a.m. to sell early morning papers, and might stay out past
              midnight to sell evening editions. Unlike children laboring in
              mills and factories, the boys and girls employed in street trades
              could enjoy the relative freedom and independence that these
              positions afforded, as well as ample opportunity to explore their
              city.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the street as their workplace, "bootblacks" and newspaper
              boys and girls experienced the same hazards as their peers who
              used the streets for play, including predatory adults, vehicular
              traffic, and theft. Their longer workdays limited their schooling,
              or made it altogether impossible.

                by state. Yet in 1900, only fifteen states had passed laws to
                curtail child labor, and they were enforced inconsistently.
                According to the 1900 U.S. Census, one in six children worked
                for wages, a proportion that had grown since 1870 and would
                continue to grow over the next decades.</span

                activist Reverend Edgar Gardner Murphy of Alabama to form the
                National Child Labor Committee (NCLC). To mobilize support for
                their cause, the NCLC hired photographer Lewis Hine to document
                child laborers. Hine traveled throughout the United States from
                1908 to 1917, photographing child workers in factories, mills,
                fields, mines, and the streets, sometimes obtaining access to
                restricted areas through subterfuge. He interviewed children to
                uncover their ages, work schedules, and education. This
                information was published in magazines, posters, and pamphlets
                along with his photographs. The scenes, previously unseen by the
                American public, inspired a collective moral outrage.</span

                  which was the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which prevented the
                  shipment of goods made in factories and mines that employed
                  children. The United States Children’s Bureau was established
                  in 1912. It was an agency with a mission broader than child

            <p>
              In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, child
              welfare became a paramount cause for activists. To the
              Progressives, no environment seemed more at odds with healthy
              child development than over-crowded and polluted manufacturing
              cities like Chicago and New York City. There, hundreds of children
              were raised in tenements where entire families might share a
              single room, often in close quarters with other families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reformers sought to study the impact of such urban environments,
              or “slums,” on children. In 1900, New York City’s Tenement House
              Commission issued a report that investigated the ability of
              tenements to provide not merely housing, but a home. They were
              found lacking, particularly because they did not accommodate the
              needs of children. The report noted that the tenements' meager
              back yards had actually shrunk over time, currently averaging ten
              feet of yard for an entire building. As a consequence,
              neighborhood children were “driven to the street.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Progressives feared that the streets exposed children to the vices
              typical of cities, including gambling, prostitution, drunkenness,
              and crime. They felt that the threat upon children’s moral
              character was equally important as the physical hazards of
              tenement life and factory work. Simply put, slums were no place
              for children.

            <p>
              As cities threatened to erode the moral and physical health of
              working-class children, Progressives idealized the country as the
              perfect antidote. Social welfare organizations developed programs
              to restore urban children’s health and vitality through sojourns
              into rural America. The New York City Fresh Air Fund was
              established in 1877 to provide impoverished children with a
              week-long stay in a rural location, where they would help with
              farm work. The Fund sought to provide urban children with a
              meaningful interruption from tenement life, rather than a short
              day trip. By 1897, fresh air programs existed in many large
              cities, including Chicago’s Fresh Air Association of Lake Geneva,
              which transported Chicago children by train north to Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other organizations, like New York City's Children’s Aid Society,
              offered children a brief respite from city life. Inner city
              children would take day trips to Staten Island, or picnic upstate
              along the Hudson River during the summer to escape the heat. The
              Newsboys Home Club organized a camp on Staten Island, which
              dues-paying boys could attend for a week.

            <p>
              In the middle of the nineteenth century, medical and health
              institutions specifically for children were rare. In fact, in the
              absence of an organization for the protection of children, the
              American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals handled
              its first child abuse case before its founder established the
              Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in 1874.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a high birth rate and rapidly growing population, it was
              inevitable that the medical profession would increase its
              attention on child care in the late nineteenth century. In 1861,
              Dr. Abraham Jacobi, known as the “Father of Pediatrics,”
              established the first children’s clinic in the New York Medical
              College.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Commonwealth Fund, a charitable organization that sought to
              improve health services, established the Child Health
              Demonstration Committee to investigate models for preventive care
              services in communities. In the 1920s, four pilot locations were
              established in North Dakota, Georgia, Tennessee, and Oregon, and
              their services were extremely successful in reducing child
              mortality rate in a few of these communities.

              Since the late nineteenth century, there had been a number of
              small, localized outbreaks of poliomyelitis, a viral disease
              commonly known as infantile paralysis, or polio. Though many
              recovered from the virus, it carried with it the risk of death or
              disablement. The first epidemic in the United States took place in
              1916, beginning with several cases in Brooklyn, New York. Over
              6,000 people died, with one-third of the deceased in New York
              City. The disease disproportionately affected children. Of the 717
              polio cases in Philadelphia during the outbreak, 456 were children
              between the ages of six months and three years.

            <p>
              By the 1940s and 1950s, polio had emerged as an epidemic.
              Outbreaks occurred nearly every year, usually in the summer
              months. Although the disease was more likely to cause paralysis in
              adults, parents were extremely fearful of exposure. With no cure,
              they attempted prevention by removing their children from communal
              spaces, such as public pools and movie theaters.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1952, among the worst years of the polio epidemic in the US,
              Jonas Salk tested the first polio vaccine. A large, widely
              publicized field trial in 1954 involved the participation of 1.8
              million children in elementary schools across the country. The
              tests showed the vaccine to be safe and effective, and, in 1955, a
              campaign for mass inoculation began.

            <p>
              Most urban children in the late nineteenth century and early
              twentieth century played on the streets and sidewalks, especially
              those who lived in densely populated tenement neighborhoods such
              as New York City’s Lower East Side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some cities attempted to legislate children’s street play. They
              saw it as, at best, a nuisance to adults, who could be struck on
              their way to work by an errant ball from a children’s game, and,
              at worst, potentially fatal to children because streetcar and
              trolley accidents were common. Eleventh Avenue in New York City
              came to be known as “Death Avenue” when the New York Central
              Railway installed tracks for a commercial train. The train
              endangered children who live along the avenue, some of whom lost
              their limbs or lives playing on the tracks. In 1908, 500 children
              marched up Eleventh Avenue in protest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children organized elsewhere to protect their ability to play in
              the streets. In 1906, a group of children called the Courtland
              Street Liberty League protested to Cleveland Mayor Tom Johnson
              when children were prohibited from playing in the streets. They
              waved banners and carried signs on their way to meet with the
              mayor, who was won over. “If the children have no playgrounds," he
              said, "they should be allowed to play in the streets.”

              Reformers at the turn of the century had a growing concern for the
              welfare of urban children, and researchers turned their attention
              to the effects of slums on children. New York City’s Tenement
              House Commission issued a report in 1900 that confirmed that
              tenements offered no space for play. The children agreed, as they
              typically played in city streets. But it was felt that city
              streets were unsuitable for children—they were hazardous to their
              physical as well as moral well-being. What was needed, reformers
              agreed, was a designated recreation space for children: one that
              provided access to the fresh air not found in poorly-ventilated
              apartments. Playgrounds were the answer.
            </p>

              Boston constructed the first playground in the United States in
              1886.Twenty years later, advocates formed the Playground
              Association of America. At first, reformers believed that children
              needed supervision and instruction for play, as well as the
              structures and space. Organized playground games, they thought,
              would introduce some constraint needed in play activities. City
              children, however, were not attracted to these supervised,
              controlled spaces. Preferring the adventure of their natural urban
              environment, many early playgrounds went unused.

            <p>
              In 1910, the Boy Scouts, founded by Robert Baden-Powell in
              Britain, came to the United States. A youth organization focused
              on service, citizenship, and outdoor skills, the Scout law
              proclaimed that "a scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly,
              courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and
              reverent." The Boy Scouts of America sought to bring urban youths
              into the natural environment and away from the corrupting
              influences of the city. Boys were awarded with badges for
              achievement in outdoor skills and crafts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Principles of good citizenship were instilled in the Scouts. Only
              three years after the formation of the national organization, the
              Boy Scouts served as crowd control for both the 1913 parade for
              Women's suffrage in Washington D.C., and President Woodrow
              Wilson's inauguration. Like adults on the home front during World
              War I and World War II, children participated in war efforts, and
              the Boy Scouts were active in collecting scrap metal and rags, and
              purchasing war bonds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the Boy Scouts program did not deny membership on the
              basis of race, its troop formation followed the segregation
              policies of local schools. As a result, segregated troops existed
              through the 1940s.

              After helping to organize the Girl Guides in Britain, Juliette
              Gordon Low formed the Girl Scouts in the United States in 1912.
              Like the Boy Scouts, this program focused on nature and the
              outdoors. <em>Scouting for Girls</em>, the official handbook of
              the Girl Scouts published in 1927, included instruction in animal
              tracking, building fires, and Morse Code. Like the Boy Scouts, the
              Girl Scouts emphasized camping and sought to teach participants to
              be self-sufficient in nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Older organizations such as the Camp Fire Girls and the Girl
              Pioneers of America aimed for the same organized leisure
              activities as the Scouts. Despite its name, the Camp Fire Girls
              had a smaller emphasis on camping and outdoor skills than the Girl
              Scouts, and included more domestic pursuits instead. The Girl
              Pioneers of America, formed in 1910, taught its members to be like
              “pioneer girls”—well-rounded individuals who had an understanding
              of nature, survival, and laws that affected children.

              With the formation of many organizations for children in the
              1910s, outdoor activities and camping was becoming a regular
              feature of childhood. Many camps opened in the 1920s for girls as
              well as boys. However, the children of farmers and the urban
              working-class were not the only ones who were thought to benefit
              from these camps. It was felt that the children of an emerging
              middle class were spending too much time indoors and losing the
              relationship to nature that their parents had. Summer camp offered
              children structured time in which to learn new skills, outdoor
              activities to foster a love of nature, and a chance to socialize
              with other children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Camps opened across the country, often near lakes. At camps such
              as Camp Kiwadinipi and Camp Ojiketa in Minnesota, girl campers
              would canoe, swim, fish, and hike. Girls were also encouraged to
              complete “gypsy trips,” on which they would trek through the
              wilderness without a route or destination, often for days.

            <p>
              Levittown, a suburban community on Long Island, New York, began
              development and was ready for occupancy in 1947, just in time for
              the postwar demand for housing. The first subdivision to boast
              thousands of cookie-cutter single-family homes, manicured lawns
              and and wide streets, it is considered the archetype of the
              American suburb. Levittown eventually had 17,447 houses containing
              82,000 people. For parents in postwar America, Levittown and the
              suburban life it represented were safe places to raise children
              away from the dangers of city life and bad influences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not everyone was encouraged to move their families to Levittown. A
              whites-only policy was printed in the original Levittown standard
              lease, although it was dropped in 1948. However, when the first
              African American family moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania, in 1957,
              a second development built by the Levitts in the same model as the
              first, homeowners protested on the new residents’ lawn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Levittown embodied the spirit of conformity that critics described
              at the heart of suburban life. It demonstrated that within this
              model of policed sameness, there was plenty of room for
              discrimination.

              The term "teenager" was first introduced to the American public in
              the 1940s as a moniker coined by advertising executives looking to
              sell their products to a new audience. The concept of a distinct
              "youth culture" had begun to develop in the 1920s, but throughout
              the Great Depression and World War II, young Americans were
              expected to put aside any frivolous activities or unnecessary
              spending for the sake of the nation’s well-being.
            </p>

              The 1950s were marked by the emergence of a distinct teen culture.
              Seeking to distance themselves from the culture of their parents,
              teenagers turned to rock and roll music and youth-oriented
              television programs and movies—all packaged for them through new
              marketing strategies targeting their demographic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teen culture in the 1950s also marked an important shift in
              American race relations. Most teenagers during this time attended
              segregated or near-segregated schools, and interracial interaction
              was limited. However, rock and roll appealed to teenagers from
              many backgrounds, and rock concerts often hosted mixed-race
              audiences. White teenagers embraced the music of African American
              musicians like Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Chuck Berry, while
              African American teenagers listened to white rock and rollers,
              such as Elvis.
