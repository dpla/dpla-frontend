            In the spring of 1918, the United States was embroiled in World War
            I, fighting alongside the English, French, and Russians against the
            Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. In total, 70 million
            men were at war on multiple fronts across Europe, Russia, the Middle
            East, and Northern Africa. The tide was finally turning for the
            Allies after a crushing offensive by German forces mere weeks
            earlier. Then, a fierce enemy intervened—an outbreak of influenza
            that would decimate entire regiments and towns, kill civilians and
            soldiers alike by the millions, and rapidly become a global
            pandemic. This disease weakened forces on both sides, changing not
            only the course of the war but also the economies and population
            stability of every affected nation. In the long term, this
            particular outbreak would inspire research on an unprecedented scale
            and lead to advances in science and medicine, forever altering our
            understanding of epidemiology.&nbsp;From the spring of 1918 to early
            1919, no aspect of life remained untouched by the pandemic for
            Americans at home and on the front. This exhibition explores the
            pandemic’s impact on American life.&nbsp;

                >The mystery surrounding the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic has
                led to many theories about the disease's origin. The prevalent
                belief at the time was that the disease came from bacteria known
                as Pfeiffer's bacillus (Bacillus influenza). Others believed the
                cause was an unbalanced diet or the anxiety of life in wartime.
                Research since then has led scientists to theorize that the
                influenza originated as a swine or avian flu, now classified as
                the Influenza A, H1N1 virus—a disease that remains active
                today.</span

              There had been prior influenza outbreaks in the US, the most
              recent pandemic occurring in 1889-1890. However, in previous
              outbreaks, it was typically the young, the old, and those with
              compromised immune systems that were the most susceptible. This
              time, primarily healthy people between the ages of 18 and 49 were
              afflicted. Symptoms ranged from typical flu symptoms, like aches
              and pains, fever, dizziness, headache, congestion, and vomiting,
              to more extreme ones, like hemorrhaging of the eyes and/or ears.
              Lungs might even fill with fluid, which slowly suffocated the
              victim. Some victims died within a few days of contracting
              influenza, whereas others died of secondary complications such as
              pneumonia.

                shores through widespread infections in military camps around
                the country. Men and women of the medical community were at the
                forefront of this growing crisis. The war in Europe meant an
                increase in the number of men in the military ranks, but also
                the number of doctors enlisted to care for them. By 1918, it was
                estimated that 30 percent of all American physicians were in
                military service. While this number was crucial to sustaining
                the military, it left a wide gap in civilian medical

                  &nbsp;Hospitals and staff were pushed to their limits with
                  homefront care, often leaving only medical students and
                  volunteers to help with the sick. &nbsp;To assist where the
                  need was greatest, the American Red Cross recruited a total of
                  15,000 nurses (ranging from students to women who took the
                  "Red Cross Home Hygiene Course") to serve both civilians and
                  the military. Of these, at least 223 nurses and five
                  dietitians died while providing care to flu victims.</span

                >Almost as quickly as the influenza pandemic appeared in the
                spring of 1918, the rate of new cases slowed by the end of 1918,
                then faded away by the spring of 1919. The immediate flu crisis
                had passed but Americans would deal with its consequences long
                after. Estimates vary, but the most widely accepted world death
                tolls reach 25 to 50 million worldwide, with more than 1.5
                million of these on American soil, in addition to military
                losses abroad.</span

                  twentieth-century Americans and their predecessors, but this
                  one was different because of its rapid spread, faster
                  progression, and disproportionate effect on the young and
                  healthy. This, combined with the loss of so many young men at
                  the front to disease and injury, led to a population lull in
                  the US that would take several years to rebound to original
                  numbers. The disease itself was so virulent that it continued
                  to mutate and resist eradication. In fact, all Influenza-A
                  outbreaks since that time have been descendants of the 1918
                  strain.</span

              The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic was unique because it came in
              three waves, whereas previous outbreaks were characterized by a
              single wave with limited geographic dispersion. This pandemic
              spread quickly and globally, claiming an estimated 50 million
              lives, among them some 500,000 Americans. In the US, the first
              wave appeared in the spring of 1918, the second in the fall of
              1918, and the third in the early winter of 1919. Of the three
              waves, the second was most fatal, which led to a theory that
              survivors of the second wave had developed protective immunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like the mystery surrounding its biological origins, there are
              many theories about where the influenza started and how it spread.
              The dominant theory at the time claimed it began in Spain in April
              1918, as evidenced by the large number of afflicted people
              documented there early on. This led to the misnomer "Spanish Flu."
              Another theory hypothesized that the flu originated at Fort Riley,
              Kansas, and spread via soldiers wherever they were deployed. Yet
              another theory suggested that soldiers brought it home from China
              where it quickly spread to US civilians. Despite numerous
              speculations, scientists have yet to determine the precise
              geographic origin of the disease.

            <p>
              During the 1918-1919 epidemic, several preventative methods were
              used to halt the spread of influenza. Public health strategies
              included physical measures, such as isolating infected individuals
              and closing down or restricting access to public places like
              cinemas, schools, churches, and courthouses. Local officials
              placed entire towns under quarantine to discourage the spread of
              influenza. Public health education campaigns discouraged coughing,
              spitting, and sneezing, and encouraged people to wear flu masks
              that covered the nose and mouth. People were also told to avoid
              public gatherings and crowds of all sorts. Although doctors and
              members of the public could not agree on the precise cause of the
              flu, it was widely understood that when large groups gathered, it
              spread like wildfire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Numerous other methods were employed to try to ward off the flu.
              Homeopathic measures ranged from rubbing raw onions on the chest,
              to applying camphor to the nose and mouth, to practicing nose
              breathing to stop bacteria from entering orally. Applying throat
              spray was also thought to inhibit the virus. People were given
              newly developed vaccines, including the popular "Rosenow Vaccine"
              that contained inactivated pneumococcal, streptococcal, and
              staphylococcal bacteria. &nbsp;Cities inoculated residents for
              free or for a low cost. &nbsp;Sadly, later studies concluded that
              this vaccine was completely ineffective.

                >On November 11, 1918, thousands of people took to the streets
                in celebration of the end of the war in Europe. But the war
                wasn't the only burden that people wished to forget. In small
                towns and large cities, the flu virus was inescapable, and it
                took an especially great toll on the nation's young. Deviating
                from past outbreaks, the death rate for young adults (ages
                15-34) was high—twenty times higher in 1918 than during the
                average flu outbreak. For example, on October 4 alone, New York
                City recorded 999 new cases of influenza, of which nearly 700
                were children. Pregnant women were especially hard-hit by the
                illness, and among the survivors, many lost their babies.</span

              <span
                >While schools were reluctant to close, volunteer-run day care
                centers were opened so that children with sick parents would be
                less easily exposed. In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, an eighteen-year-old
                who had just received his military physical became the town's
                first casualty on October 8. &nbsp;Soon after, placards were
                placed on the doors of those who were reported to be infected
                with the flu. As with adult gatherings, children’s favorite
                places of amusement, like playgrounds and fairs, closed down
                nationwide.</span

                transmission of the flu, it is not surprising that the US
                economy was adversely affected by the pandemic. One of the
                earliest preventative measures had been to stagger the opening
                and closing hours of businesses to lessen congestion on public
                transportation, which meant lower revenues for transportation
                companies. Hundreds of small businesses also had to close due to
                staff shortages and bankruptcies were common after the
                pandemic.</span

                >Interestingly, one industry flourished during the flu
                outbreak—the liquor industry. In Baltimore, Maryland, saloons
                were spared restrictions other businesses faced due to the
                alleged medicinal value of liquor. In Charleston, South
                Carolina, dispensaries were set up so citizens could receive a
                rationed quart of whiskey, which many waited hours in line to
                get. Alcohol, it seems, brought Americans relief, however
                temporary.

                >The trenches, where much of the fighting took place during the
                Great War, were deadly in many ways. In trench warfare, soldiers
                protected themselves from enemy fire by fighting from below
                ground in deep but narrow dugouts surrounded by barbed wire.
                Conditions in these trenches were atrocious by modern standards.
                Damp, cold, dirty, vermin-infested, and sometimes covered with
                human remains, they were the perfect setting for viral mutation,
                hastening the spread of the disease through close contact. These
                suboptimal conditions were not limited to close spaces like
                battlefield trenches or crowded barracks. Once contracted,
                influenza travelled with victims as they moved from place to
                place, whether on foot, by train, or aboard ships. Realizing
                this, American medical officers attempted to convince the War
                Department to reduce crowding on ships and other transport, but
                to no avail. Consequently, all forms of troop and supply
                transport continued to spread the virus globally.</span

              <span
                >While it's tempting to think that stronger efforts to contain
                influenza where it raged would have stopped its spread, this
                would have been impractical during wartime, when the advantage
                gained by moving troops and equipment quickly and efficiently
                was crucial. Such efforts might have slowed the spread of
                influenza, but it is unlikely they would have completely stopped
                transmission because of the impossibility of total
                quarantine.</span

                determined the course of the fighting and of international
                relations during World War I. The American military was one of
                several armies severely weakened by the flu. All nations
                involved in the war were hard-hit by the pandemic, with American
                losses alone numbering over 63,000. More than half of the total
                losses in the last months of 1918, in fact, were attributed to
                disease. The British forces, by comparison, lost roughly one in
                nine servicemen to the flu during a similar period, and the
                Central Powers suffered comparable losses.</span

                >During the early twentieth century, medical knowledge of
                disease transmission improved as the pandemic accelerated public
                understanding of the importance of cleanliness in disease
                prevention. A newly developed vaccine for typhoid had stopped
                what was a primary cause of death among servicemen in past
                conflicts, and World War I inspired similar advances in
                influenza deterrence.</span

                  >Almost as soon as the first outbreak began, scientists and
                  physicians strived to pinpoint the origin of "Spanish Flu" in
                  order to stop transmission. The resulting medical
                  interventions happened so rapidly that by the war's end (less
                  than a year after the pandemic's peak), losses from disease
                  had already decreased due to better prevention and higher
                  sanitation standards, as well as therapeutic and surgical
                  developments. The post-war period brought continuing research
                  and development, culminating in the discovery of an effective
                  flu vaccine in 1945. Unfortunately, even these significant
                  advances couldn't keep the flu completely at bay. A second flu
                  pandemic swept the US in 1957-1958, taking another 70,000
                  lives, followed by another in 1968-1969, both of which led to
                  a new, more effective flu vaccine for children in 1985. Recent
                  years have brought further advances in influenza research,
                  including better vaccines. All of these medical breakthroughs
                  were set in motion by the pandemic of 1918.

                >In the immediate aftermath of the war and the deadly pandemic,
                Americans struggled to put the devastation behind them. Wartime
                media built morale through joyful themes in everything from
                music to advertising in an effort to help Americans forget the
                gloom of wartime life. Songs such as "Happy Days are Here Again"
                (published a decade later, but inspired by the armistice)
                encouraged optimism amongst postwar Americans. The darkness of
                Edwardian art and architecture gave way to the exuberance of
                Expressionism and Art Deco.</span

                >Despite this brightness, however, a certain caution remained.
                Communities nationwide, especially larger cities, endeavored to
                maintain sanitation and health standards by posting public
                bulletins to increase awareness and establishing public health
                clinics for the poor. Almost as quickly as it had appeared, the
                flu became memory. By summer 1919, when President Woodrow Wilson
                contracted it in Versailles, the flu's death rate returned to
                normal from its high levels during the pandemic. Although the
                virus mutated and remained dangerous for years to come, in the
                years following World War I there was a palpable sense of relief
                and jubilation among Americans who had survived both the war and
                another terrifying enemy—the flu pandemic of 1918.
