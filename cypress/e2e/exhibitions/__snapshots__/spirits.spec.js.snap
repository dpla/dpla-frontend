            December 2013 marks the 80th anniversary of the end of Prohibition,
            the period between 1920 – 1933 when the manufacture, transport and
            sale of intoxicating liquors was illegal in the United States. The
            18th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1919, was the
            crowning achievement of a temperance movement that had been building
            in this country since the late 1700s. Alcohol consumption had peaked
            to a high of about 7 gallons per person in the early 1800s (compared
            to less than 3 gallons today), with recognized health and societal
            consequences.
          </p>
          <p class="normal">
            But the new laws were difficult to enforce, due to general
            unpopularity and the profits that could be made through
            circumventing the law. Demand for alcohol remained high, and
            organized crime and corruption flourished. Loopholes and exemptions
            also allowed home wine production, and prescriptions for medical
            alcohol rose dramatically. Enforcement difficulties, popular
            resistance, and economic pressures associated with the Great
            Depression all contributed to efforts to repeal Prohibition. In
            1933, the 21st Amendment ended national prohibition and returned
            responsibility for alcohol regulation to the states.

              Early European colonizers in North America were used to drinking
              beer as a result of unsafe water in their native countries and
              they continued this practice in the new land. One certain source
              of beer was the tavern, which provided lodging, food and drink for
              travelers and locals as well. The Dutch settlement of New
              Amsterdam had a full scale brewery by 1612, and local
              micro-breweries were established to supply beer to other areas
              throughout the colonies.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Hops grew wild in New England and beer, drunk throughout the day,
              was made with a wide variety of ingredients, including fermented
              malt, roots, and pumpkin with additions of boiled bark from
              spruce, sassafras or birch trees. Fruit and vegetable wines were
              made by colonial farmers, who used honey as a source of
              fermentation, and honey was also fermented into mead. Apples were
              not native to New England but once orchards were established in
              the mid-1600s, mildly alcoholic cider became a favorite beverage
              for all family members; some was fermented into hard cider.

              The seeds of the temperance movement were sown by one of the
              Founding Fathers when he published an essay detailing his belief
              that heavy alcohol consumption could damage physical and
              psychological health. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration
              of Independence and a physician, turned public opinion regarding
              the “medicinal benefit” of alcohol on its head.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              During the time Rush was writing his essay, a revival known as the
              Second Great Awakening was going strong, and led directly to
              support of temperance for religious reasons. Protestant churches
              took the lead, and The American&nbsp;Temperance Society was formed
              in 1826.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              &nbsp;By the 1870s, women had joined the call for temperance. The
              Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) increased its power and
              influence as it allied itself with Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth
              Cady Stanton, and other women battling for the right to vote.
              Perhaps the name most closely associated with the temperance
              movement is Carrie Amelia Moore Nation, also known as “Carry A.
              Nation.” A Kentucky native and vehement supporter of temperance,
              she was known for vandalizing saloons with her hatchet, and
              encouraging her temperance sisters to do likewise, crying, “Smash,
              ladies, smash!”

              Influenced by the growing temperance movement, state legislation
              regarding sale and consumption of alcohol appeared as early as the
              mid-19th century. In 1851, Maine became the first state to
              prohibit the manufacture and sale of liquor, yet the law was
              repealed five years later. Kansas was another early enactor of
              anti-liquor laws, outlawing alcoholic beverages in 1881. The
              Sunflower State was also the launch pad for Carrie Nation’s
              outspoken and often violent temperance activism. Between 1900 and
              1910, Nation was arrested over thirty times for destroying Kansas
              saloons with hatchets and rocks.

              The Prohibition movement spread throughout the United States,
              gaining the most popularity in the South. Alliances were tied to
              religious beliefs; Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians tended to
              side with the “dries” and Protestants and Catholics with the
              “wets”. By early 1917, temperance supporters held a majority of
              seats in Congress, drawing members from the Democratic and
              Republican parties alike. In August 1917 the Senate passed a
              resolution to institute nationwide Prohibition. By 1919, the
              legislation had been ratified by 36 of the 48 states.

              While the 18th Amendment prohibited the manufacture, transport,
              and sale of alcohol it did not outlaw the drinking of alcohol. The
              American thirst for alcoholic beverages did not subside as
              expected. The amount of rum entering the U.S. from the Caribbean
              dramatically increased. The demand for moonshine increased and
              enforcement agents increased efforts to shut down illegal and
              untaxed alcohol manufacture and distribution. Many rural Americans
              began to make their own corn whiskey that was often more potent
              than any legal spirits to be made before Prohibition. Saloons
              became soft drink saloons and speakeasies flourished.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Because the taste of the available liquor was rough, bartenders
              used sweeteners and other additives resulting in a number of
              cocktail recipes that are still popular today. The number of
              prescriptions for medicinal liquor dramatically increased as
              doctors and pharmacies became distribution outlets for legal
              liquor. Because there were no legal controls, stills blew up,
              bottles exploded and people were poisoned by drinking tainted
              spirits.

              When the 18th Amendment passed it was expected that the social
              ills of the country would dry up and that the laws would be
              relatively easy to enforce. Nothing could have been further from
              the truth. A number of unintended consequences resulted from the
              new laws. As saloons closed and speakeasies opened women found
              venues for drinking alcohol that had been previously unavailable
              to them.

              The Roaring Twenties saw the rise of jazz music and dancing as men
              and women socialized together. Cocktail recipes such as the Mary
              Pickford, the Sidecar, and the French 75 were developed to mask
              the taste of poor-quality liquor. The huge amounts of money tied
              to the import and distribution of illegal liquor fueled crime and
              led to the organization of criminals into a national syndicate.
              Organized crime as we know it today is tied to the development of
              crime families during Prohibition. Corruption of police officials
              was rife as organized crime figures paid off police and
              enforcement agents to either look the other way or to actively
              participate in protecting their activities.

              Prohibition grew from Victorian-era temperance movements but was
              enacted in the Jazz Age. The country was experiencing a period of
              economic prosperity, consumerism and an emphasis on leisure and
              recreation activities. Passage of the 18th Amendment contributed
              to changes in the culture. Prior to Prohibition, saloons were
              patronized almost exclusively by men. Speakeasies, however, were
              open to men and women. There was a drop in overall alcohol
              consumption, and a shift from primarily beer and wine consumption
              to cocktails. Distilled alcohol was easier to store and transport,
              and the added flavorings could mask the flavor of poor-quality
              alcohol.
            </p>

              With the fall of the stock market in 1929 and start of the Great
              Depression, economic factors contributed to efforts to repeal
              Prohibition. Repeal would provide jobs for the unemployed and a
              source of tax revenue.&nbsp;

              Early colonists brought ales and wines with them to the New World.
              They continued to import, but also began producing locally.
              Distillation – the process of boiling a liquid to separate the
              components – is a process that has been used worldwide since
              ancient times. Distillation of fermented solutions such as beer,
              wine or mead results in a product with a higher alcohol content.
              Distilled alcohol can be stored longer than beers and wines, so
              producing distilled beverages became a good way for farmers to use
              excess grain to produce a marketable product. Through the mid-18th
              century, most spirits were produced by small farmer-distillers.
              There were no laws to limit production and excess product was easy
              to store, transport, trade and sell.&nbsp;

              The establishment of taverns was a vital tradition among early
              colonists, who brought with them to the new country the practice
              of drinking beer and other alcoholic beverages. Not only did the
              early taverns provide food, liquor and lodging for travelers, but
              they frequently served as de facto town meeting houses and
              courthouses. Drinking alcoholic beverages was commonly seen as not
              only acceptable, but beneficial. But drunkenness was considered
              undesirable and various local laws such as those regulating the
              establishment of closing times, limitation on the volume of liquor
              served, and fines for the excessive drinker and/or the server were
              not uncommon.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              &nbsp;Prior to 1820, taverns dominated as drinking establishments,
              but their replacement by hotels with their “hotel bars” offered an
              alternative, and by 1850 saloons were prominent. On the urban East
              coast, these generally took the form of politically-oriented
              saloons, while on the American frontier saloons were commonly
              characterized as having swinging doors, a long bar, spittoons, and
              tables for playing cards, but the variety of saloons was in fact
              immense. By 1900, there were an estimated 300,000 U.S. saloons,
              three times the number in 1870.

              The use of alcohol for medicinal purposes is documented in
              writings from ancient Egypt and other early cultures. Alcohol does
              have “medicinal” properties; it is antiseptic and (in high doses)
              can be an anesthetic. In ancient times, medicinal properties may
              also have been ascribed to alcohol in cases where the water supply
              was not clean, and drinking alcohol was a safer option. Distilled
              alcohol was also useful historically as a solvent to create
              medicines from botanicals. Juniper, for example, was believed to
              be useful in treating fevers and other conditions; gin was
              initially a medical product.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The alcohol used in creating medicines also served as a
              preservative. Alcohol was believed to be useful in treating
              conditions ranging from high blood pressure to tuberculosis.
              Toward the end of the 19th century, however, advances in science
              and laboratory techniques contributed to reduced acceptance of
              alcohol in medical treatments. In 1916, whiskey was removed from
              The Pharmacopeia of the United States of America.

              Following the Revolutionary War, alcohol consumption grew to the
              point where drunkenness was met with increasing disapproval and
              abuse of alcohol was seen as a cause of poverty, crime, disease,
              spousal abuse and family neglect. The widespread availability and
              low cost of rum and whiskey contributed to the epidemic of
              alcoholism during this period; by 1830 the per capita consumption
              of American adults was estimated to be seven gallons of pure
              alcohol annually.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The first prominent temperance advocate was Dr. Benjamin Rush,
              whose 1784 pamphlet, “An Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent
              Spirits Upon the Human Minde and Body,” strongly influenced public
              opinion. Temperance associations were formed in several states
              before 1820, and the movement flourished with the formation of the
              American Temperance Society in 1826, which counted over 1.5
              million members within 12 years. The Protestant revival movement
              adopted temperance and clergy warned congregations against the
              evils of distilled spirits. By 1849, consumption of pure alcohol
              by American adults had dropped 75% per capita. The early
              temperance movements declined by the Civil War as the country
              focused on the issue of slavery and the threat of dissolution of
              the nation.

              The temperance movement was one of several reform movements
              underway during the antebellum and post-Civil War era in America,
              and at times the movements and their leaders united. The religious
              revival known as the Second Great Awakening occurred throughout
              the U.S. and was characterized by evangelical Protestant preachers
              who reached beyond the elite parishioners of New England to the
              less wealthy and less educated. Their hell-and-damnation sermons
              produced new denominations, communal societies and reform. The
              temperance, abolition, and women’s rights movements grew at this
              time; other reformers supported dietary reforms, restrictions on
              the use of tobacco, and dress reforms.

              Women who would otherwise not speak out in public were empowered
              by their motivation to speak against the consumption of alcohol in
              order to protect their homes and family. This activism resulted in
              the entry of some into the political arena where they advocated as
              well for increased marital rights, universal suffrage, and
              abolition of slavery. Brewers and the liquor industry opposed
              giving the vote to women on economic grounds, believing that they
              would enact prohibition. Members of the reform movements differed
              in approach and philosophy and were far from united in thought or
              action.&nbsp;

              Temperance movements began in the late 1700s, initially as
              movements to encourage moderation in alcohol consumption. By the
              1800s, temperance societies in America were promoting abstinence
              and working toward legislation aimed to curb drinking. The spread
              of the temperance movement was in response to high alcohol
              consumption during this period, especially by men, at a time when
              women had few legal rights and were dependent on the support
              provided by their husbands.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              One of the leading temperance societies in the US was the Woman's
              Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The WCTU grew from the “Women’s
              Crusades” of the 1870s, where groups of women walked to saloons
              and drug stores where alcohol was sold, to sing and pray. The goal
              of these events was to decrease attendance at saloons and increase
              attendance at church. The WCTU furnished “temperance fountains” in
              some cities to encourage the drinking of water instead of spirits.

              January 1919 brought the crowning achievement of the Temperance
              movement: the United States was voted dry. The 18th Amendment to
              the United States Constitution, which prohibited the manufacture,
              sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors in the United
              States, was ratified by 46 states; only Connecticut and Rhode
              Island rejected the amendment. By the terms of the amendment, it
              was slated to go into effect one year after ratification, which
              allowed time for development of appropriate legislation for
              enforcement.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Later that year, the National Prohibition Act (also called the
              Volstead Act) expanded on the 18th Amendment and the previously
              enacted War Prohibition Act by specifying strength of alcohol that
              was prohibited, penalties for lawbreaking, and exceptions that
              could be made for medicine, religious rituals, and scientific
              research. Neither law actually prohibited the consumption of
              alcohol for enjoyment, but they made it more difficult to obtain
              legally.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The 18th Amendment was repealed in 1933 by the 21st Amendment; to
              this day, it is the only constitutional amendment to be repealed
              in its entirety.

              Enforcement of Prohibition was difficult and ultimately
              ineffective. Enforcement was initially largely delegated to state
              and local police. On the federal level, the Prohibition Unit
              (later called the Bureau of Prohibition) was established within
              the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The unit was later moved to the
              Treasury Department and then Department of Justice, ultimately
              evolving into today’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
              (ATF). The demand for alcohol was high, and organized crime gangs
              grew wealthy and powerful in meeting that demand, importing
              alcohol from other countries and establishing illegal bars
              (“speakeasies”) to sell it.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Enforcement methods included setting up fake speakeasies, tapping
              phone lines, and executing raids. Illegal alcohol sale was so
              profitable that even with raids and arrests by law enforcement,
              speakeasies and other illegal activity thrived. Corruption was
              also rampant, further complicating enforcement efforts and making
              convictions after arrest relatively rare.

              Prohibition in the United States officially ended after 14 years,
              with the ratification of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution.
              This amendment specifically repealed the 18th Amendment (which
              prohibited the manufacture, sale, or transportation of
              intoxicating liquors in the United States) and returned control of
              alcohol regulation to individual states, only banning
              transportation of alcohol when it violated local laws. Many states
              opted to remain dry, though none are completely dry today. Many
              states now delegate alcohol regulation to counties and
              municipalities.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The 21st Amendment is the only constitutional amendment to date to
              repeal a previous amendment, and also the only one to have been
              ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than state
              legislatures; this method was chosen so that average citizens
              could weigh in on this sensitive issue without political pressure
              from the temperance lobby. 38 state conventions ratified the
              amendment, which officially took effect on December 15, 1933.

              The 18th amendment prohibited the manufacture, transport and sale
              of alcohol in the United States, but did not specify how the ban
              was to be enforced. The Volstead Act identified penalties, defined
              “intoxicating liquors” and specified exceptions, such as medical
              use. Enforcement was difficult due to a number of factors. A
              significant proportion of the public had been accustomed to
              (legally) drinking alcohol and viewed the new law as unnecessary
              or an imposition of someone else’s moral code.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              As a result, many defied the ban or supported those who defied it.
              Organized crime gangs grew wealthy supporting illegal alcohol
              trade, and could pay off poorly-paid enforcers. Finally, the
              degree of opposition to prohibition was underestimated and the
              resources provided for enforcement were insufficient.

              Enforcement of the prohibition law fell to the Department of the
              Treasury and intercepting the flow of rum via the sea fell to the
              Coast Guard. Over the years, bootleggers devised a number of ways
              to try to avoid capture while transporting their liquor. One of
              the most common was to enhance, or "soup up" the engines of the
              cars they drove. Their sea-faring counterparts had more logistical
              problems to overcome. Rumrunners would dock their loaded ships
              beyond the three-mile limit of US government jurisdiction and
              unload the cargo to smaller boats under the cover of night. The
              larger ships could then sail into port, subject to routine
              inspections without the fear of detection.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The Coast Guard found it difficult to enforce the prohibition of
              alcohol as there were hundreds of these “mother ships’ anchored
              off shore from the major ports. Large profits increased the
              activity. One measure of such activity could be measured by the
              amount of liquor that passed through Nassau, Bahamas on route to
              the U.S.: 50,000 quarts in 1917 to 10,000,000 in 1922.&nbsp;

              Tension between the government and alcohol producers is
              long-standing, dating back to 1794 when a whiskey tax was imposed
              leading to the “Whiskey Rebellion”. The Civil War saw the
              reinstatement of excise taxes on whiskey and tobacco in an effort
              to raise funds for the troops. The government kept the taxes in
              place after the war to help fund the reconstruction of the nation.
              After the Civil War the Revenue Bureau of the Treasury Department
              was formed with revenue collectors or “revenuers” acting as a
              police agency and going after moonshiners.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Congress increased the whiskey tax in 1894 with the intent to
              raise more money. The unintended consequence of this higher tax
              was to create a larger demand for the (illegal) untaxed liquor.
              Many distillers chose to sell their product illegally rather than
              pay the higher taxes. Moonshining grew in popularity at the end of
              the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. As pressure was put
              on legitimate distillers by temperance and prohibition movements
              the demand for moonshine increased.&nbsp;

              As Prohibition became law of the land in January 1920 the
              manufacture, sale, and distribution of alcohol became illegal.
              Those in favor of Prohibition predicted that enforcement of the
              law would be easy and inexpensive, but this quickly proved not to
              be the case. Gangs who before 1920 limited their activity to
              gambling and thievery found new opportunities as they organized
              into groups of bootleggers supplying illegal liquor brought into
              the country for those wanting to drink. Bootlegging gangsters
              became very wealthy.&nbsp;Infamous Chicago gangster Al Capone’s
              income was estimated to be more than $100 million a year.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              By the late 1920s the gangs were so organized they held a national
              convention in Cleveland, Ohio. They discussed creating a national
              crime syndicate. At a subsequent meeting in Atlantic City in 1929
              the country was divided into nine territories with a national
              Commission made up of representatives from each territory. When
              the profitable bootlegging period ended with the repeal of
              Prohibition in 1933 the gangs focused on other crimes including
              gambling, prostitution, and drug distribution.

              Instead of solving problems of criminality as originally intended,
              the prohibition of alcohol gave rise to widespread crime and
              corruption. Within the first hours of the Volstead Act taking
              effect there were already liquor robberies and hijackings and
              within the following month the first federal agents were arrested
              for liquor law corruption. Bootleggers routinely paid off police
              officers to allow their illegal activities to continue. America
              was facing a dark decade in which corruption became routine, and
              crime more profitable.

              The Wickersham Commission, organized by President Hoover in 1929,
              studied the problems associated with Prohibition and found it had
              caused a number of social and political problems. The Commission
              recognized that Prohibition was unenforceable and provided great
              potential for police corruption. The commission released a second
              report in 1931 that supported prohibition but found that the
              average American held the law in contempt and that enforcement was
              impossible. The report documented corruption in police ranks,
              local politics and problems in every community that attempted to
              enforce prohibition laws.&nbsp;

              The major women's political activity of the late 19th and early
              20th century was not organized around political rights or feminism
              but around the temperance movement. Prohibition of alcohol was a
              major reform movement from the mid-1800s through the 1920s. Women
              were at the heart of the movement that was rooted in Protestant
              denominations such as Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists,
              and Presbyterians.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Before Prohibition, temperance activism by women was fueled by
              heavy-drinking husbands. Saloons were generally for men, the only
              women typically found there being prostitutes. Prohibition became
              law in 1920, but it did not stop people from drinking. Saloons
              were replaced by speakeasies, and women joined men in frequenting
              the illegal establishments. A new era of freedom was ushered in
              for women as the vote for women was ratified in August of 1920.

              “Blue Laws” are laws originally designed to enforce compliance
              with Christian Sabbath, restricting some activities such as
              alcohol consumption on Sundays, and requiring others, such as
              church attendance. The term “blue” is likely from 17th century
              use, meaning a rigid moral code. Several states still have blue
              laws in effect, restricting sale of alcohol on Sundays. The
              Supreme Court has interpreted current laws as secular – promoting
              a common “day of rest” – and so not a violation of separation of
              church and state. There remain towns and counties in the US where
              alcohol cannot be sold at all.

              After the repeal of Prohibition, there was still concern for and a
              need to provide assistance to those suffering from alcohol
              addiction. Social aid organizations formed to provide support for
              those trying to achieve sobriety. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),
              established in 1935, is one of the best known mutual aid
              movements. AA reports that it has helped over two million members.
              Its “Twelve Step” approach to recovery has been adopted by many
              other organizations seeking to help people end various
              dependencies.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, inc. was
              founded in 1944. Its core beliefs are that alcoholism is a disease
              that can be treated, a public health problem, and the public’s
              responsibility. NCADD serves not only individuals, but workplaces,
              schools, government, and many other organizations.
            </p>
            <p class="normal">
              Treatment is available through some hospitals. Inpatient treatment
              usually includes physical and psychiatric care, detoxification,
              talk therapy, and introduction to AA. Outpatient treatment tends
              to work best for those with mild withdrawal symptoms, and includes
              counseling, medication, AA, and family involvement. While many
              treatment organizations hold fast to a program of abstinence,
              others believe moderation can be achieved.

              Microbreweries flourished in the United States before Prohibition.
              Without refrigeration, beer would have gone bad before it could be
              delivered any great distance, so most towns had a small brewery to
              serve the local population. Alcoholic beverages have been
              home-brewed for 7,000 years. During Prohibition, Americans
              continued home crafting beer and wine. While making beer was
              illegal, making wine and cider from fruit at home was protected
              under Section 29 of the Volstead Act. Post-prohibition, many home
              brewers began selling their beer at local bars, and the
              microbrewery was reborn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, though states may restrict or prohibit the manufacture of
              alcoholic beverages, many people make beer, wine, cider, and other
              fermented drinks at home. They are no longer permitted to sell
              their potables, as alcohol brewed for public consumption is
              subject to federal government excise taxes. According to the
              Brewers Association, there are 1,195 Brewpubs, 790 Microbreweries,
              and 90 Regional Craft Breweries in the United States, including
              one in the White House. President Obama brews three varieties of
              beer, all made with honey from the White House beehive.
