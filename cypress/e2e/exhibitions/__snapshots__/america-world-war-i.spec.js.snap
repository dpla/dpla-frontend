            Amidst tensions over European political and territorial boundaries,
            the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian terrorist
            in 1914 derailed peace in the western world by sparking World War
            I—one of the highest-casualty conflicts in modern times. While
            European nations quickly engaged, the United States immediately
            declared neutrality. By 1917, however, remaining neutral was no
            longer an option.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Great War would bring the United States out of isolationism and
            onto the world stage. It would also change life on the American home
            front forever. A centralized government took control of American
            life in an unprecedented fashion by instating a mandatory military
            draft, controlling industries, initiating food and ration
            restrictions, and launching elaborate campaigns to encourage
            patriotism.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most important, if temporary, changes brought by the war
            at home came from the stifled flow of labor, as men were pulled away
            by the draft and immigration slowed. The need for American labor
            provided second-class citizens, such as women and African Americans,
            a brief opportunity for better jobs. This glimpse would help foment
            in them a desire for more and equal opportunities after they were
            pulled away once more at war’s end.

                >On June 28, 1914, a Serbian terrorist assassinated Archduke
                Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
                Austria-Hungary avenged their leader by declaring war on Serbia.
                What on other continents may have remained a localized conflict
                instead ignited a series of complicated alliances in
                imperialistic Europe. Serbia allied with Russia; Russia allied
                with France. In turn, Austria-Hungary joined forces with
                Germany. Soon, Great Britain joined Russia and France while
                Turkey joined Germany and Austria-Hungary. By early August of
                1914, these nations were embroiled in a war of international
                proportions and control of Europe was on the line.</span

                  Because it provided a haven to immigrants from all of the
                  European countries already involved in the conflict, choosing
                  allegiances was a complicated matter. In 1916, US President
                  Woodrow Wilson won re-election campaigning on a isolationist
                  platform that explicitly opposed the country's involvement in
                  the European war. Wilson’s government managed to keep this
                  promise for three years. But events leading up to the entry of

                >When the United States joined the war on April 6, 1917, the
                nation’s military forces were comprised of only 200,000
                soldiers. By the end of that month, only 97,000 additional men
                had enlisted willingly, prompting government officials to employ
                more aggressive recruitment tactics. The Selective Service Act
                was issued on May 18, 1917, requiring all male citizens aged
                twenty-one to thirty to register for the draft by June 6, 1917.
                Twenty-four million men registered for the draft and almost
                three million were drafted into service.</span

                had established thirty-two of these units to expedite the flow
                of experienced soldiers into the conflict. In many cases,
                soldiers arrived at camps before the camps were ready for them.
                Early images of these camps show the buildings in disarray, with
                windows yet to be installed and tools scattered around those in
                training.</span

                source of food to those Allied nations where the battle overran
                production areas like farms and manufacturing plants. In 1918,

            <p>
              To appease citizens who balked at the idea of increased taxes from
              the United States' involvement in the war, President Wilson began
              a bond campaign to fund military efforts and ease the burden to
              the taxpayer. The war bonds campaign raised nearly 21 billion
              dollars over the course of the conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campaign targeted women in particular, with the organization
              of bonds run by women’s clubs, the YWCA, and the Red Cross, which
              had wide female support. The Red Cross alone blossomed from a mere
              267 chapters nationwide to a staggering 2,300 over a few months in
              1917, with volunteering women attending chapters to package
              supplies and produce clothes for the soldiers. &nbsp;

                “Bernard Baruch,” 1919. Bernard Baruch was a financier who made
                his fortune on Wall Street in large part due to an innate
                understanding of business and industry. His World War I service
                was so successful, he would be called on as an economic advisor
                during World War II as well. Courtesy of Belle W. Baruch

            <p>
              Before entering the conflict in 1917, the United States needed to
              prepare not only its army, but also its economy. President Wilson
              formed the War Industries Board (WIB), which was assigned to
              oversee the nation’s finances and economy. The first two men
              assigned to head this group resigned due to the lack of actual
              control over the nation’s spending and intense stress, as the
              Board remained powerless in its first incarnation because of
              Wilson’s antitrust convictions. In 1918, Wilson increased the
              Board’s reach and handed its leadership over to Bernard Baruch, a
              successful American financier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Board was granted full rights to allocate supplies, fix
              prices, and standardize goods throughout the country. About
              one-quarter of all goods and foodstuffs produced was sent to the
              frontlines in Europe. One of the largest challenges facing Baruch
              and the WIB was the issue of labor. The work force took a major
              hit during the war as America closed its doors to new immigrants
              and shipped able-bodied men to war. Women and African Americans
              were able to take advantage of these holes in the labor force by
              joining industries in which they had previously been denied
              involvement.

            <p>
              World War I officially ended on November 11, 1918, with Armistice.
              Throughout the course of the war, two million American troops
              traveled to France, with approximately three-quarters of those
              soldiers participating in combat. Some 60,000 Americans died in
              battle, while over 200,000 were wounded. An additional 60,000 died
              of disease, many from the influenza pandemic that killed over
              twenty million people across the globe in 1918 and 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
              The homecoming of Americans who had gone to the frontlines was met
              with much fanfare and many a parade. Meanwhile, memorials began to
              spring up for those soldiers who did not return home. While
              340,000 total Americans were lost during the war, a staggering
              nine million people were lost on a wider scale, putting in
              perspective the devastation felt by the European nations.

                  1,000 people lost their lives in the event, among them 128
                  Americans. The loss of American citizens fanned the flames of
                  nationalism, as recent immigrants expressed loyalty to their
                  new nation rather than to their distant homelands already
                  involved in the conflict. American retaliation was, it
                  appeared, inevitable.</span

                "An education for you. Join the tanks U.S. Army," 1918. This
                United States Army Tank Corps recruitment poster emphasizes the
                ability to learn a new skill in the armed services. Courtesy of

            <p>
              To encourage those who had little or no military experience, the
              United States government marketed the draft with an enlistment
              campaign that made use of visual propaganda. Posters and other
              advertisements promised enlistees the opportunity to learn new
              life skills through education, such as repairing machinery and the
              less broadly applicable art of flying. The images, with their
              sinewy, all-American figures and heroic scenes, were intended to
              spark the viewer’s patriotic spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Temporary recruitment offices were set up in public places
              throughout the country, including one on the Common in Boston,
              Massachusetts.

                  >Overall, the Select Service Act of 1917, which mandated
                  enrollment in the military draft for those between twenty-one
                  and thirty years of age, received little pushback. The United
                  States government had learned from its previous mistakes</span
                ><span>; </span
                ><span
                  >when it authorized the Enrollment Act of 1863, it brought
                  many new soldiers into the Civil War, but also incited much
                  resistance. As part of that resistance, draftees could hire a
                  substitute to participate or pay a fee to avoid service, and
                  many men of means did just that. Draft evasion was so common
                  that the Civil War is often referred to as a “rich man’s war
                  and a poor man’s fight.” In contrast, in the 1917 draft, with
                  no substitute or evasion possible, the pool of draftees
                  represented a broader, more representative cross section of
                  American life.</span

                with over 200,000 fighting in Europe. Because of systemic racism
                and discrimination, most African American troops were assigned
                to support roles and did not participate in combat. In fact,
                only two infantry divisions comprised of African Americans
                (about 42,000 men) fought “in the trenches” during the

                time than any other American unit. Upon their return home, the

            <p>
              Over 21,500 female nurses from the United States served in the
              course of the Great War. Beyond these roles, for the first time in
              history, women were allowed to join the military for duties other
              than nursing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The US Navy actively recruited women for service, pulling an
              initial 13,000 female volunteers into their ranks. While these
              women served exclusively stateside, they received compensation
              identical to that of their male counterparts, and veterans
              benefits that honored their participation. In addition, another
              233 American women served near the front lines in France as
              bilingual translators. More than 300 women served in the Marines
              in administrative roles, allowing men who had formerly filled
              those positions to take combat roles. Just as propaganda posters
              appealed to a masculine patriotic duty to encourage men to enlist,
              other advertisements were tailored specifically to women,
              depicting them as strong, uniformed, and, most significantly,
              patriotic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite their service in World War I, women were not permitted to
              enlist in the military again until 1942, when a global conflict
              again called upon their service. Nevertheless, women’s involvement
              would motivate many to advocate for equal rights at home—namely
              through women’s suffrage campaigns that culminated in the passage
              of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.

                  in the three years that it took for the United States to join

                  technology in Europe had evolved beyond horseback with the use
                  of trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns. Nevertheless, the

                on the home front to be mindful of limiting their food

                  accustomed to “rationing” and not wasting food. For this
                  reason, Hoover’s movement did not target them as actively as
                  it did middle- and upper-class households. To make matters
                  worse for impoverished families, labor rules and regulations
                  were relaxed at home during the war, allowing companies to
                  demand longer and harder hours on the job in factories.</span

                participation in the War, timberman Charles Lathrop Pack
                advanced the idea of “war gardens” to help augment food
                production and increase food supply for those at home and the
                Allied nations abroad. As organizer of the</span

              ><span
                >he argued that the increase in production of food at home could
                free up those in food transport or food sales and send more
                Americans in these roles abroad. President Wilson seconded this
                call for service, imploring all those with gardens or unused
                back lots to do their part to help in the war effort and
                announcing that “food will win the war.”</span

                  their own gardens as contributions to “victory” by producing
                  more food, and to “put the slacker land to work,” thereby
                  taking advantage of open, unused, or recreational land as a
                  location for more gardens. Creators of these victory gardens
                  were also educated in canning and otherwise preserving excess

              The Young Men’s Christian Association, more commonly known as the
              YMCA, began as a community prayer group in Switzerland in 1844. As
              the organization grew and joined with a sister network, the YWCA,
              it became increasingly secular. By the twentieth century, the YMCA
              was working primarily in urban communities, offering Christian
              entertainment to deter youth from engaging in crime. YMCA members
              also mentored young participants by offering training in skills
              that would serve them in the labor force.
            </p>
            <p>
              During World War I, the YMCA played an active role both at home in
              the United States and abroad. On the home front, the organization
              launched clean-up campaigns on the streets and offered courses in
              emergency action and food conservation during Herbert Hoover’s
              initiative to decrease food consumption and waste.

                >Founded in 1881 by Clara Barton, the Red Cross remained a
                relatively small and quiet organization until World War I. At
                the onset of the war, the Red Cross sent doctors and nurses to
                Europe to set up hospitals and medical tents. This practice
                proved unsustainable given their funding, prompting the
                organization to recall those doctors and nurses from the
                conflict.</span

                  purchase supplies as part of the relief efforts in Europe. A
                  far more successful campaign was launched in 1917, the same
                  year that the United States military joined combatants
                  overseas. At the beginning of that year, it claimed 267
                  chapters nationwide; by the summer, the Red Cross counted over
                  2,300 branches full of volunteers making clothing and
                  packaging goods for those on the front lines. By the end of
                  the war, 20 million volunteers brought in through Patriot

                industries to keep private enterprises from raising the cost of
                military and wartime resources amidst demand. Among the
                industries who felt these regulations most strongly were the
                textile and shoe industries, which were inundated with orders
                for boots and uniforms to outfit soldiers.</span

                  as shipping and railways to maximize efficiencies during World
                  War I. The Shipping Act of September 7, 1916, regulated trade
                  practices and maritime carriers, as well as private ship
                  construction, to ensure that all shipping efforts were
                  directed towards military purposes. Three billion dollars went
                  into reinvigorating the industry. Although about 1,000 cargo
                  ships were built, this was not quite the success it may seem.
                  Many of the ships built were made of wood and therefore next

                >Although the Great Migration of subjugated African Americans
                out of the US South began in 1900, the restriction of
                immigration with the onset of World War I and the deployment of
                laborers to join the military ranks brought job openings for
                African Americans in record numbers in the North and Midwest.
                During the war, more than 300,000 African Americans left the
                south with its Jim Crow laws, racialized violence, and poor
                economic conditions to make better lives in northern
                industries.</span

            <p>
              <span
                >The lives that African Americans found beyond the southern
                borders proved a major disappointment. Those who migrated found
                that many white northerners were just as racist as their
                southern counterparts. Race riots, lynchings, and segregated
                housing were commonplace. In fact, segregated housing still
                persists today in many northern cities, such as Detroit and
                Milwaukee. Even those factories that employed African Americans
                during WWI forbade many of them from taking on highly skilled
                jobs, while unions banned them from entry.</span

                  citizens through much of the twentieth century, aspects of
                  black culture were celebrated in the worlds of music and
                  literature. The Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance, through
                  literary greats like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston,
                  would change America forever.</span

                vote in 1920, female citizens who had joined the ranks of
                laborers were pushed back into the home as soldiers took their
                places back in industry.</span

                African Americans from southern to northern states. This was not
                welcome news for many who maintained racist, segregationist
                views. Southerners resented the loss of cheap labor for farms
                and northerners retaliated against new competition for jobs in
                factories. In 1919, there were twenty-five major race riots and
                eighty-three lynchings. Soldiers returning home having fought
                for their country found a nation where human rights for all
                Americans were fundamentally denied.</span

                  during World War I, and who wanted their elevated roles in
