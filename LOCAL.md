# Configuring a new DPLA Local instance

These are the main areas relevant to any Local instance:

- Environment Variables
- Static File Folder
- SCSS Theme
- Local Constants File

## Environment Variables

- `SITE_ENV` is the variable that determines if the instance is a Local, if it has a value of `local`. This variable also needs to be set up in `constants/env.js`.

- `LOCAL_ID` determines what Local will be loaded in the given instance, since all Locals share the same codebase. Each Local must have a descriptive and unique ID (with no spaces, for example: `wisconsin` for Recollection Wisconsin). This variable also needs to be set up in `constants/env.js`.

## Static File Folder

Static files belonging to each Local need to be placed in a subfolder of the `static/` folder. The subfolder needs to be named with the `LOCAL_ID` (for example `static/wisconsin/` for Recollection Wisconsin). Files that go in this folder are:

- Local favicon file displayed in browser tabs (filename defined in the Constants file below)
- Local logo file displayed in the header and footer (filename defined in the Constants file below)
- `about.md` containing the text for the about page
- `homepage.md` containing the text for the home page
- `terms.md` containing the text for the terms and conditions page
- `home-hero-bg.jpg` with the hero image shown in the home page
- `manifest.json` with a manifest of files

## SCSS Theme

Locals use a theming system that allows basic color customization. This customization must follow [WCAG contrast and color requirements](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/). Theme files follow a similar structure as the static file folder above but in the `stylesheets/themes/` folder and contain a single `theme.scss` file (for example `stylesheets/themes/wisconsin/theme.scss` for Recollection Wisconsin). The file itself contains the necessary color customizations for the Local.

## Local Constants File

Since all Local instances share the same codebase, there is a [`constants/local.js`](constants/local.js) file that contains the necessary configuration variables for an instance:

- `theme`: name of the SCSS file that contains the theme (should preferrably be the same as the `LOCAL_ID` for consistency)
- `name`: name of the Local, appearing throughout the site
- `favicon`: filename for the Local's `favicon` displayed in browser tabs
- `logo`: filename Local's logo shown in header and footer
- `description`: used in the `description` metadata field, sometimes displayed by search engines in their results
- `provider`: URL-encoded value used to restrict the search interface results to items belonging only to the specified `provider` (for example `%22Recollection%20Wisconsin%22` for Recollection Wisconsin)
- `locationFacet`: URL-encoded value used to restrict the search interface results to items with the specified `sourceResource.spatial.name` (for example `%22Wisconsin%22` for Recollection Wisconsin)
- `subjectFacet`: URL-encoded value used to restrict the search interface results to items with the specified `sourceResource.subject.name` (for example `%22Wisconsin%22` for Recollection Wisconsin)
- `hasAbout`: determines whether to show (`true`) or not (`false`) the “About” link in the top navigation
- `externalLink`: URL for the top navigation link with the Local's `name`
