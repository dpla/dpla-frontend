### About BSCDN
#### Who We Are 
Big Sky Country Digital Network (BSCDN) is a partnership of the Montana State Library (MSL), Montana Historical Society, Montana State University, the University of Montana and North Dakota State Library. This partnership supports a local service hub of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). 
 
#### What We Do 
BSCDN collects information about Montana and North Dakota digital resources and submits this information to the DPLA where it is exhibited alongside nation-wide digital resources. Newspapers, images, books, and digital collections are presented on one platform with world-wide availability. 
 
### Services 
#### How We Help 
BSCDN aggregates partners' metadata into a single standard, addressing metadata concerns (including copyright and licensing labeling), and working with partners to remediate issues. BSCDN is supported by partners who understand the opportunities and challenges of our Big Sky community. 

BSCDN provides assistance by sharing tools and techniques for quality assurance, normalization, standardization, and metadata enhancement. This assistance may be in-person or supported with webinars or online training. 

BSCDN provides guidelines and support for digitization, long-term storage, and preservation activities. We communicate with partners and community through professional development and community outreach opportunities, and we share our knowledge and learn from other hubs in the DPLA network.
