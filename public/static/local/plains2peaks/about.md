## About the Plains to Peaks Collective

The Plains to Peaks Collective (PPC), the Colorado-Wyoming Service Hub of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), is a collaboration between the Colorado State Library and the Wyoming State Library that brings together unique collection material held by our partner libraries, archives, museums and collecting institutions. Through this portal PPC partners share their unique digital collections with a wider national audience of avid researchers, genealogists, students, teachers and history buffs.

## About the Digital Public Library of America

The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) brings together descriptive information about collection material from participating libraries, archives, and museums, in the United States and makes it freely available to the world.

DPLA Service Hubs are state, regional, or other collaborations that bring together the digital collections from institutions within their respective communities. Single institutions with substantial individual collections are also included in the DPLA Network.

## Who is Frontier?

Frontier is the name given to our PPC logo â€“ the ubiquitous Colorado-Wyoming pronghorn.

We chose the pronghorn to be our symbol because of its characteristics: independent, resilient, and stalwart, yet with the capacity to join together to create a larger and more powerful presence when warranted.
