## Statement on Potentially Harmful Content

The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a portal to millions of freely available items from thousands of libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage organizations across the United States.
DPLA contains some content that may be harmful or difficult to view. Our cultural heritage partners collect materials from history, as well as artifacts from many cultures and time periods, to preserve and make available the historical record. As a result, some of the materials presented here may reflect outdated, biased, offensive, and possibly violent views and opinions due to pervasive systemic intolerance. In addition, some cultural heritage institutions collect and preserve materials relating to violent or graphic events which are preserved for their historical significance.
