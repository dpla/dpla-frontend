By modern standards, Americans during this period knew very little about human physiology, biochemistry, and endocrinology. They sought quick solutions for medical problems that they did not necessarily understand. Doctors, when available, were not always to be trusted. Hospitals, where available, were often considered places where people went to die. Patent medicines offered quick, convenient, and inexpensive relief from arthritis, depression, and mental illness, as well as women’s problems, indigestion, liver problems, and lack of hair growth. Children were dosed with medicines to aid their growth, feed their blood, and facilitate the movement of their digestive tract.  </p>\n<p>A lack of government regulations enabled the sale of drugs that contained opium, laudanum, paregoric, alcohol, tar, and other ingredients consumers would not consider ingesting today. Increased government regulation brought about the end of the patent medicine era. In 1906 Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, with the strong support of President Theodore Roosevelt. Although patent medicines continued to be produced after that date, new, stricter regulations demanded that ingredients be printed on labels, false claims be toned down, and advertising be more truthful. The legacy of this era lives on in today’s television infomercials for “miracle cleaning products” and “fast weight loss solutions.”</p>","id":1288,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1594,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/5b0eea307d4d7c82fc003dfe955b8a75.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/5b0eea307d4d7c82fc003dfe955b8a75.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/5b0eea307d4d7c82fc003dfe955b8a75.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/5b0eea307d4d7c82fc003dfe955b8a75.jpg"}}],"id":1288,"caption":"<p>North Star Lung and Throat Balsam advertisement.

Given the prevalence of these addictive ingredients, it is not surprising that many products were enthusiastically endorsed by their users. Patent medicine drugs were usually created from a mixture of vegetable compound with alcohol, morphine, opium, or cocaine. At this moment in US history, the medical profession did not recognize the dangers or addictive natures of opiates.  As a result, many doctors advocated the use of cocaine and other drugs. Alcohol was included as a “preservative” ingredient; but the alcohol levels found in patent medicine could be as high as sixteen percent—the same alcohol level found in commercially-produced wine.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of addictive ingredients combined with the drugs' ready availability helped to create a culture of “self-dosing” or “self-medicating.” Beginning with the Mexican-American War in 1846 and later, during the American Civil War (from 1861 to 1865), the mid-nineteenth century saw an increase in communicable diseases which spread quickly and easily. Two-thirds of the soldiers who died during the Civil War perished due to disease, not battle wounds. Common camp illnesses included typhoid fever, ague fever, pneumonia, scurvy, malaria, tuberculosis, and smallpox. All of these diseases needed treatment or cures, and producers of patent medicines stepped in to provide solutions.</p>","id":1292,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1595,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/581b93438cc8bf132eae3a290261679e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/581b93438cc8bf132eae3a290261679e.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/581b93438cc8bf132eae3a290261679e.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/581b93438cc8bf132eae3a290261679e.jpg"}}],"id":1292,"caption":"<p>A Kennedy-Andrews Drug Company supply catalog, 1906.

Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound?\" </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>—Lydia Pinkham Medical Company, 1920 pamphlet </em></strong></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps the most famous purveyor of medicines for women was Lydia Pinkham. Born Lydia Estes in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1819, she married Mr. Pinkham in 1843 and subsequently raised a family. It was not until later that she produced her famous “vegetable compound” that would change her life and elevate women’s concerns to a national level. This compound was concocted from a recipe her husband obtained as part of the payment of a debt. The concoction was marketed as a “women’s tonic” and was promoted as relief for menstrual cramps and the discomforts of menopause. Lydia Pinkham’s compound debuted in 1875 and eventually her entire family was involved in its production. Her children filled bottles and folded advertisements.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Pinkham’s business flourished long after her death in 1883. An image of her was included on the bottles and helped perpetuated her image as a hardy and resourceful New Englander who was also a woman that other women could trust. Pinkham’s image was also distributed directly to druggists in the form of advertising cards, souvenir plates, and gift items. </span></span></p>","id":1305,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1611,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/3be3082e6590cb38b98ea4de4ca35f77.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/3be3082e6590cb38b98ea4de4ca35f77.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/3be3082e6590cb38b98ea4de4ca35f77.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/3be3082e6590cb38b98ea4de4ca35f77.jpg"}}],"id":1305,"caption":"<p><span><span>A portrait of Lydia Pinkham, signed \"Yours for Health,\" ca. 1885.

Eventually Jumbo was brought to England by the London Zoological Gardens. Jumbo lived at the London Zoo for sixteen years and was a favorite of both children and adults. Jumbo was the single largest elephant in captivity and the American showman and circus-owner, P. T. Barnum, wanted Jumbo for his own. Barnum purchased Jumbo in 1882 and brought the elephant to America. Jumbo’s arrival in the United States ushered in an era of “Jumbo-mania,” in which all things related to Jumbo the elephant were wildly popular. The American consumer market were flooded with thousands of images of Jumbo endorsing thread, birthday cards, candy, clothing, jewelry, soap and various patent medicines.</p>\n<p>Jumbo was killed by a Grand Trunk Freight Engine in Ontario, Canada in 1885. In typical Barnum fashion, P. T. announced Jumbo’s death as a “hero’s death,” and he promoted the idea that Jumbo gave his life to save that of a baby elephant. Jumbo’s legacy lived on long after his death. He was the single most popular animal used in advertising images.  From sewing thread to Castoria Oil, Jumbo’s image was used to sell products.
