His father oversaw mining and transportation interests. Roosevelt entered politics early, taking on the Tammany Democrats in New York and ultimately putting a dent in this powerful political machine.</p>\n<p>Not always successful in politics, Roosevelt partnered with Louis Howe to save his career. A New York journalist, Howe would play an important role in rebuilding Roosevelt's political career that would ultimately send him to the oval office. Roosevelt's ability to campaign was limited by an early bout with polio that would dog his health throughout his life. So, Howe and Roosevelt focused on getting the word out through print to his mostly rural constituency. Newspaper advertisements highlighted \"FDR's support of better prices for farm products, a rollback in license fees for fishermen, and the standardization of apple barrel sizes, which would prevent apple growers from being cheated by buyers.\"</p>\n<p>Howe also helped Roosevelt's brilliant but introverted wife, Eleanor, morph into an effective politician in her own right.

Instead, private industry was left to build roads and rail, oversee the working conditions of their employees, and self-govern economic practices. Roosevelt, with the help of Congress, created many \"'alphabet agencies' -- so-called because they were known by their abbreviations\" – that, as never before, took control of the construction of public utility infrastructure and put into place social, economic, and employment safety nets, some of which remain today.</p>\n<p>To be sure, not all of the programs were successful or lasting, but many had immediate impacts on impoverished individuals and the failing banking system. The TVA created employment from Kentucky to North Carolina, the AAA attempted to stabilize farm prices, and FERA “provided funds for state welfare programs.\" In fact, the creation of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) restored confidence in the banks during the Great Depression and played a continuing role in ensuring banking stability during the Great Recession of the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>Arnesen, Eric, \"A new deal for Americans,\"<em> Cobblestone,</em> Vol 26, Issue 4 (2005): 6-9.</p>\n<p> </p>","id":380,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":660,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/a5fbe75595976a12663892357fdf05a0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/a5fbe75595976a12663892357fdf05a0.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/a5fbe75595976a12663892357fdf05a0.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/a5fbe75595976a12663892357fdf05a0.tif"}}],"id":380,"caption":"<p class=\"title\"><span>President Franklin D.

During Roosevelt’s time as governor of New York, he had become good friends with Harry Hopkins. Hopkins had over 20 years of experience with social work and welfare issues.</p>\n<p>Roosevelt realized that most of the federal government’s relief efforts had never been successful because they often got stuck in political wrangling. To prevent these problems, Roosevelt told Hopkins to focus on action rather than the complications of politics.</p>\n<p>The three goals of the Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA) were (1) to be effective, (2) provide work for employable people on the relief rolls, and (3) to have a diverse variety of relief programs. FERA provided grants from the federal government to state governments for a variety of projects in fields such as agriculture, the arts, construction and education. Many people who were receiving relief aid were highly trained, skilled workers. The hope was that by providing many different types of jobs and salaries that were similar to workers’ previous jobs the whole country would benefit.</p>\n<p>“Essay: The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA),” University of Washington Digital Collections. <a href=\"http://content.lib.washington.edu/feraweb/essay.html\">http://content.lib.washington.edu/feraweb/essay.html</a> </p>","id":386,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":682,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/0ee7db8cca7ffb73ae8cf2a4a07199ec.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/0ee7db8cca7ffb73ae8cf2a4a07199ec.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/0ee7db8cca7ffb73ae8cf2a4a07199ec.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/0ee7db8cca7ffb73ae8cf2a4a07199ec.tif"}}],"id":386,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Factory financed by FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration) for producing starch from sweet potatoes.

The FSA was not a relief agency, but instead it relied on a network of cooperation between states and county offices to determine which clients needed loans that could not get this credit somewhere else. Farmers could use these loans to buy land, equipment, livestock, or seeds. Additionally, the FSA assisted families by providing healthcare, education, and training programs for participating families. The goal of these measures was to help families become self-sustaining.</p>\n<p>One of the most memorable programs of the FSA is the collection of photographs that document the rural conditions from the Information Division of the Resettlement Administration. These photos helped to not only promote the programs of the RA, but to also show the people, cultures, and landscapes of rural America.</p>\n<p>“Farm Security Administration,” <em>Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture</em>.
