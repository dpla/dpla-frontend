The programs FDR implemented, therefore, had long-lasting effects on America’s social, cultural, infrastructural, and economic landscapes. The legacy of the New Deal comprised both an escape from the harsh economic realities of Great Depression and a gradual shift in the structure of government agencies and national projects, the legacy of which still endures today.</p>\n<p>Among the changes prompted by the New Deal, those with the most notable lingering effects are those for which we can still see physical evidence: utilities, transportation, and national parks.

This meant that more than three million men between 1933 and 1942 went to work in the parks and forests performing tasks such as “planting trees, building flood barriers, fighting fires, and maintaining roads and trails.” One of the legacies of the CCC was that over three billion trees were planted in just nine years.</p>\n<p>The CCC not only showed that the federal government valued protecting the environment, but also that many government agencies could join together in the face of national struggle to create a stronger nation. The Department of Labor recruited young men, the War Department trained them, and the Department of Agriculture decided on and managed the specific jobs of the workers.

This meant that more than three million men between 1933 and 1942 went to work in the parks and forests performing tasks such as “planting trees, building flood barriers, fighting fires, and maintaining roads and trails.” One of the legacies of the CCC was that over three billion trees were planted in just nine years.</p>\n<p>The CCC not only showed that the federal government valued protecting the environment, but also that many government agencies could join together in the face of national struggle to create a stronger nation. The Department of Labor recruited young men, the War Department trained them, and the Department of Agriculture decided on and managed the specific jobs of the workers. The work of these young men would become the foundations of the National Parks.</p>\n<p>“Introduction: The Civilian Conservation Corps,” <em>American Experience</em>.

The FSA was not a relief agency, but instead it relied on a network of cooperation between states and county offices to determine which clients needed loans that could not get this credit somewhere else. Farmers could use these loans to buy land, equipment, livestock, or seeds. Additionally, the FSA assisted families by providing healthcare, education, and training programs for participating families. The goal of these measures was to help families become self-sustaining.</p>\n<p>One of the most memorable programs of the FSA is the collection of photographs that document the rural conditions from the Information Division of the Resettlement Administration. These photos helped to not only promote the programs of the RA, but to also show the people, cultures, and landscapes of rural America.</p>\n<p>“Farm Security Administration,” <em>Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture</em>.

Hopkins, the director of many of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal Recovery programs, knew that by “giv[ing] a man a [handout]… you save his body and destroy his spirit. [But by giving] him a job… you save both body and spirit.” The Works Progress Administration (WPA) gave over 8.5 million people jobs, as well as boosting workers’ self-esteem.</p>\n<p>Along with the repair and construction of roads, bridges, public parks, and public buildings, the WPA also paid for federal art, theater, music, theatre, and writing programs. Many criticized the act of federal dollars going towards art programs, but Hopkins defended the decision by saying, “[artists] have got to eat just like other people.” By supporting tens of thousands of artists, over 2,500 murals and 17,000 sculptures were created for public buildings all over the country. The National Foundation for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities were two organizations created by the WPA that are still around today.</p>\n<p>“The Works Progress Administration (WPA),” <em>American Experience</em>.

These projects include New York’s Triborough Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel. The Agency’s reach was not limited to road; the PWA is also responsible for electrifying the Pennsylvania Railroad along parts of the East Coast. The WPA also produced a number of projects that not only employed workers in dire need of employment, but also continue to this day to facilitate transportation in the US.
