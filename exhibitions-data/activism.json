Abernathy leads a kneel-in at city hall in Albany, Georgia, during which he prays for the community, its leaders, and the leaders of the civil rights movement before police arrest him and his fellow demonstrators. The clip begins with a silent portion in which groups of African Americans get out of cars near city hall and walk towards the building. Rev. Abernathy exits one of the cars in a group with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. William G. Anderson, Slater King, and Reverend E. James Grant; president, vice president, and member of the Albany Movement respectively. The demonstrators line up in front of city hall and are met by local police, led by Albany police chief Laurie Pritchett. Pritchett gives directions to his officers and to those in the kneel-in as cameramen and reporters surround the group. The sound portion begins with Pritchett informing the demonstrators that they are under arrest. King appears to ignore the statement and asks Abernathy to pray. Abernathy prays for the city of Albany; the city officials, including the mayor and chief of police; and the members of the police force. Pritchett then interrupts the prayer, directing his officers to round up the demonstrators. Abernathy continues to pray for peace in the community, and for a willingness in the city officials to negotiate with the leaders of the African American community. He prays that those attending the kneel-in will not feel hate or animosity, and for their leaders by name, including Anderson, King, and Reverend Benjamin Gay, chaplain of the Albany Movement, who is not seen. The end of Abernathy's prayer is not recorded. The clip continues with Pritchett again informing the group that they will be arrested if they do not leave. The demonstrators begin to move towards city hall and King stops to give a reporter a prepared statement he did not get to read. The clip ends with cameramen and reporters watching the demonstrators enter city hall. Abernathy, King, Anderson, and others came to city hall with the goal of speaking to the city commission; when they were informed that the city commission would not meet with them before the next meeting  scheduled for August 7, they began to pray. A second kneel-in, led by Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leader Charles Jones, took place at city hall later in the day;  the participants in that event were also arrested.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WALB (Television station : Albany, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

Abernathy, and Albany Movement president Dr. William G. Anderson speak at a press conference on July 12, 1962 upon their release from jail. Both King and Abernathy were released from serving a forty-five-day jail sentence when an unknown person purportedly paid their fines. King and Abernathy had been arrested in Albany, Georgia during a march in December 1961, and decided to serve time rather than pay a fine if they were found guilty. Albany city officials, aware of the media attention King received while in jail, arranged a plan and released the two leaders saying a \"well-dressed Negro\" had paid their fines. Although released from jail, Abernathy affirms that he and King will stay in Albany to continue working with the Albany Movement as private, concerned citizens interested in settlement and discussion of the dismissal of charges against seven hundred Albany citizens who had also been arrested. Anderson says that the Albany Movement is open to negotiations with the city of Albany. Behind King, Abernathy, and Anderson, Wyatt Walker, Executive Secretary for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Slater King, vice-president for the Albany Movement, are seen. City leaders repeatedly refused to negotiate while demonstrations persisted, but during the press conference, King asserts that the movement will not be intimidated into inaction or retreat. The concerns of the Albany Movement, according to King, will be resolved when the city of Albany accepts integration as the law of the land. Accepting the \"Albany Manifesto\" with its five proposals of the Albany Movement regarding the desegregation of parks, train and bus stations, and release of citizens arrested in the protests would be a temporary solution that would clear the way for discussion. King was, in part, upset because his own jail release had been accelerated by city officials (who paid his bail) in an attempt to minimize his publicity; he had been counting on serving the jail time to offset the criticism of other activists who claimed he was unwilling to suffer the discomforts that he encouraged others to endure for the movement. The clip ends with King speaking at a mass meeting held at Mt. Zion Baptist Church.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

While neither the demonstrators nor the leaders of the Albany Movement were violent during the disturbance, King says that the civil rights movement abhors violence so much that they are compelled to assume some responsibility for any destructive behavior of African Americans who were present.  In response to the dispute, civil rights leaders declare a \"day of penance\" in which there will be no demonstrations and ask that those who adhere to nonviolent principles pray for those who have not yet assimilated them.  King regrets that violence plays into the hands of segregationists, and that public officials are exploiting the outbreak \"for their own political capital.\"  King also announces afternoon plans to take a team disciplined in nonviolence into businesses, pool halls, and taverns of Albany's Harlem neighborhood to educate residents about appropriate nonviolent tactics and to encourage their practice.  As explanations for the crowd's actions, King cites the July 23, 1962 beating of a pregnant Marion King, the pregnant wife of Slater King, no relation to Martin Luther King, by guards in Camilla, Georgia; and the April 15, 1962 slaying of Albany African American restaurant owner Walter Harris by local police.  He avows, however, that these are not excuses.  African Americans may develop a sense of discontent and at times bitterness after being the victims of so much violence.  King states that although he believes that only a small minority of the activists have been violent, the movement will reconsider scheduling night demonstrations.  Demonstrations at any time, day or night, will only resume if a commitment to nonviolence is demonstrated in the Albany community; King is optimistic that this will prove to be the case.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

The demonstrators then stand in a circle in front of the Sumter County Courthouse, where they clap and sing, \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.\"  Willie Bolden, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) member working in Americus, addresses the gathering on the local, regional and global manifestations of racial conflict.  \"All you have to do,\" he says, \"is go into a community and you will find problems when it comes to black-white relationships.\"  Bolden asks the audience and the mayor to engage Americus directly as it remains a source for these problems.  After a break in the clip, Mayor Walker responds vaguely to Tom Brokaw's question about plans for a conference with civil rights leaders; he clarifies that any discussions conducted with African Americans will take place with local leaders.  When asked about reactions to a white demonstration held at the fairgrounds the previous evening, he conveyed appreciation that the meeting emphasized adherence to the law.  Walker explains to Brokaw that some of the African American community demands, such as integrated voting, are county issues over which he has no control as mayor.  He dismisses the activist strategy of boycotting white merchants, and announces that the city council will meet as necessary to address concerns.  Civil rights demonstrations in Americus took place periodically beginning in the summer of 1963, and lasting through the summer of 1965.  On July 20, 1965, four African American women were arrested for attempting to integrate a county-held special election, where the first African American woman candidate in Sumter County was included on the ballot; the arrest revived demonstrations. On July 30, the women were released on order of federal judge W. A. Bootle, and on August 13, demonstrations were halted by the Sumter County Movement, the local civil rights organization.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

Williams declares that civil rights workers will do what is necessary to bring about justice in the area, although there have been beatings, harassment, and rumors of law enforcement officers intentionally failing to protect demonstrators who become victims of violence.  He mentions sending North Carolina SCLC field secretary Golden Frinks as an emissary of SCOPE. Williams adds that if the situation continues to worsen, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., head of the SCLC, will come to Americus.  He outlines the civil rights demands for Americus, including: increased access to voter registration; release of Mary Fishe Bell and her compatriots; law enforcement protection for all citizens; and the establishment of a biracial committee with African American members selected by the black community.  Additionally, Williams demands a resolution to conflict over the recent Sumter County elections. On July 20, Sumter County held a special election for Justice of the Peace in which Mary Fishe Bell, a 24-year-old Spelman graduate, was the first African American woman to run for public office in the county.  During the election, Ms. Bell and three other African American women were arrested for trying to integrate the \"white\" voting line. Williams proposes that this be done by voiding the results, rescheduling the election, and releasing those arrested; he promises that the demonstrations will halt when the demands outlined are met. The four women were held on $1000 bond from July 20 until July 30 when federal judge W. A. Bootle ordered their release, and declared the segregated elections illegal.  Finally, Reverend J. R. Campbell, president of the Sumter County Movement, answers a reporter's questions about impediments to voter registration.  Campbell explains that African Americans wishing to register to vote are hampered by the unpredictable hours of the registrar's office and as well as the literacy tests.  They also must overcome harassment and fear of the sheriff, the courthouse, the polls, the power structure, and brutality and lack of protection.  After President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, seventeen-hundred African Americans in Sumter County registered to vote within a two-week period, almost doubling the number of registered black voters.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

Although a small number of stores desegregated before negotiations concluded, Augusta experienced little integration prior to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

King describes his October 1961 request to President John F. Kennedy to issue a \"Second Emancipation Proclamation,\" symbolically freeing African Americans from discrimination and marking the centennial of President Abraham Lincoln's initial declaration. King also addressed the issue of African American voting, saying \"one of the most significant steps that the Negro can take at this hour is that short walk to the voting booth.\"  The statement was made in advance of intensified voter registration efforts by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and their work with the Voter Education Project (VEP) with the goal of doubling the number of registered African American voters in the South. King proposed that every Southern church should have a social action committee with the motto of \"Every member ... a registered voter.\"  King quips that \"even Mr. Roy Harris respects votes.\"  Roy V. Harris, Augusta native and former Speaker of the house in the Georgia House of Representatives, was considered a \"master of white-only, rural-dominated politics\" and was known to staunchly support segregation. The selections of King's comments end with affirmations that although those in the movement may face violence, jail, death, and slander, ultimately, \"we shall overcome.\" After a period of applause for Dr. King's remarks, reverend C. S. Hamilton, leader of the Civil Rights movement in Augusta, speaks about the plans for the week of the Masters Golf Tournament, including mass meetings celebrating the week and newspaper sales.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

He commends Powell for \"being bold enough to repeat what the honorable Elijah Muhammad [head of the Nation of Islam] has been saying for thirty-three years,\" but explains that the possibility of race riots existed before it was recognized by Powell.

Kennedy expresses his satisfaction with the recent progress in the resolution of racial conflicts in Birmingham, Alabama.  President Kennedy reports that the Department of Justice is investigating alleged voter discrimination in Birmingham, and has supported efforts in the Supreme Court to remove the city's segregation ordinances.  He confirms that the administration's primary goal is to foster communication in the resolution of African American concerns; the administration believes that federal civil rights statutes have not been violated during the current crisis. Burke Marshall, assistant attorney general, representing President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy in Birmingham is working \"to halt a spectacle which was seriously damaging the reputation of both Birmingham and the country.\"  President Kennedy praises the business community's pledge to address \"the justifiable needs\" of local African Americans.  He explains that civil rights leaders agreed to end demonstrations, and that Albert Boutwell, the newly-elected mayor, had pledged that  that the city would commit itself \"wholeheartedly to continuing progress in this area.\"  Kennedy hopes that the conflict will remind other communities of the importance of \"equal opportunity and treatment.\"  He concludes by urging the continued \"constructive and cooperative efforts\" of both black and whites.  While the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) had led civil rights efforts in Birmingham for several years, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) began assisting with concentrated actions against segregation on April 3, 1963.  Local merchants, effected by a longstanding economic boycott of segregated downtown businesses, initiated discussions with civil rights leaders at the end of April.  Pressure on city officials to negotiate increased substantially after May 3, the day that Birmingham public safety commissioner Eugene \"Bull\" Connor directed police officers and fire fighters to disperse young demonstrators (who were participating in the second day of the Children's Crusade march) with high-pressure fire hoses and dogs.  White and black leaders reached a compromise one week later that ended the demonstrations on May 10.  It was also at this time that Connor, along with other Birmingham city commissioners, was involved in a legal battle to prevent the city of Birmingham from revising its structure as a city commission in favor of a mayor-council municipal government; Connor and the city commissioners lost the lawsuit May 23.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

The clip begins with Dr. King sitting at a table at an outdoor press conference surrounded by reporters and photographers. Apparently responding to a question, King clarifies that he believes in the idea of \"black power\" if it means \"amassing political and economic strength so that the Negro can achieve his legitimate goals.\"  He condemns the connotations of separatism and violence that surround the phrase declaring that \"there is no salvation of the Negro through isolation\" and that violence \"only serves to relieve the guilt of the white community while increasing their fears.\"  The camera focuses for a moment on a woman who is standing on a balcony and looking down on the press conference below. Next King asserts that gubernatorial candidate Lester Maddox cannot stop the civil rights movement; continuing King suggests that Maddox through his extremism unites African Americans and white moderates. He concludes that the civil rights movement will continue whether or not Maddox is elected. The philosophy of \"black power\" as embraced and endorsed by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) supported African American independence and even supremacy over white citizens and culture. The move by SNCC and CORE towards \"black power\" increased the tensions and division between these organizations and other civil rights groups including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) which remained more concerned with obtaining legal rights and economic opportunities.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

Comments in the clip are not always completely recorded. Dr. King sits at a table with microphones in front of him. Fellow Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) leader reverend Andrew Young stands beside him. King begins by mentioning newspaper articles advocating that he become a presidential candidate for the 1968 election; he announces that he will not do so. Next King warns of a potential national disaster if the United States government continues to focus on war at the expense of racial equality. Even if the Vietnam War escalates and \"make relevant an independent candidacy\" King proclaims that he will not consider a political office. When an off-screen reporter asks King who he thinks would make a good candidate for president King avoids the question by asserting his hope for an end of the Vietnam War, which he believes would make an independent candidacy unnecessary, and reiterating that SCLC does not endorse political candidates. Although he has no basis for his hope that the war will end King believes that millions of citizens will \"oppose this war very vigorously\" and that this opposition to the war will encourage the government to change its position. After this the discussion turns to SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael; although King and Carmichael do not agree on everything King points out they both oppose the Vietnam War and encourage African American freedom in the United States. King suggests that there are some positive aspects to the \"black power\" slogan as long as the slogan does not involve or embrace violence. King cites a conflict between what Carmichael has said to him privately that opposes violence and what the media portrays as Carmichael's position advocating violence. King attributes a recent conflict in Nashville, Tennessee following a Carmichael appearance to existing conditions of poverty, police brutality, and despair, not to Carmichael. After a break in the clip King suggests that African Americans are capable of being president but have been unable to do so because they have been \"held out of the political arena.\"  Asked about a possibility of Alabama governor George Wallace as a presidential candidate King condemns Wallace for \"eighteenth century thinking that has no place in the twentieth century.\"  He insists that a Wallace campaign would \"create the atmosphere for new bigotry, new hatred, and ultimately new violence.\"  The clip ends with King commenting again about the Vietnam War, proposing that if the boxer Cassius Clay, known also as Muhammad Ali, is jailed for refusing to go to war, other young men in the country will consider the possibility of refusing the draft. Muhammad Ali was convicted of refusing induction into the army and was stripped of his professional boxing titles in 1967.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.

In 1960, Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver, Jr. was faced with a decision to either close public schools or comply with a federal order to desegregate them.  To avoid conflict with the federal government, He directed the Georgia General Assembly to create the General Assembly Committee on Schools.  The committee was charged with gauging public sentiment regarding school desegregation and reporting back to the governor.  Atlanta businessman John Sibley was selected to lead this effort, and therefore the committee was often referred to as the Sibley Commission.  Although He believed in segregation, Sibley hoped to minimize support for massive resistance to school desegregation for practical reasons.  He held ten public hearings across the state in which the debate was confined to two choices: continuing massive resistance at the expense of the school system or amending state law to allow token integration while keeping segregation largely intact.  Most of those in attendance at the meetings supported total segregation of the schools. Sibley recommended that the state accept the federal decision to desegregate the schools despite the commission's findings.  In January of 1961, Governor Vandiver introduced a bill that accepted the Sibley Commission's recommendations for desegregation.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Wilson, Bill (William Bryan), 1914-1993","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Atlanta History Center","element":{"name":"Source","id":48},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Digital Library of Georgia","element":{"name":"Source","id":48},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"1960","element":{"name":"Date","id":40},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"geh_wilson_ahc099272007a.tif","element":{"name":"Identifier","id":43},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"http://54.245.164.12:3000/dlg/items/tif/geh_wilson_ahc099272007a.tif","element":{"name":"Original Format","id":7},"element_set":{"name":"Item Type Metadata","id":3},"html":false}],"id":810452}}]}],"title":"Public School Desegregation"},{"parent":{"id":134,"resource":"exhibit_pages"},"slug":"university-desegregation","id":136,"order":1,"page_blocks":[{"text":"<p>On January 6, 1961, federal Judge W.

The students against integration argue that the state provides educational institutions for African Americans and ask why Holmes and Hunter do not want to attend those institutions. The student for integration explains that the African American colleges do not provide the same opportunities as white colleges. One of the students against integration responds that the University of Georgia also pays to send African American students to out-of-state institutions if they want to go. The student for integration asks his fellow debaters if they would like to have to attend school out of state instead of having the privilege of staying close to home. The students against integration repeat that the state provides African American institutions, adding that African Americans would not be able to build the schools without the state's financial support. The student for integration counters that African Americans do not have the same employment opportunities and so do not pay as much in taxes as white citizens. Continuing, he asserts that the African American students seeking integration want to improve their economic and educational status. He concludes by asking if African Americans are lesser citizens of the state than those with whom he is debating.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Walter J.
