Established as part of President Roosevelt’s New Deal, it aimed primarily to provide relief to out-of-work actors and theater professionals by funding of theatre performances across the country and secondarily to bring relevant art in form of theatre to all Americans, particularly those who were suffering economically during the Depression. At its peak, it employed over 12,000 workers nationwide. Under the leadership of Vassar College theater professor Hallie Flanagan, the Federal Theatre Project aimed to establish itself as a national theater program. Breaking with the past, it adopted a new, innovative, and inclusive approach to theater production--or as Flanagan put it, “re-thinking rather than remembering.” The goal was to create quality, entertaining productions but Flanagan, in particular, also emphasized theater’s value in educating and engaging audiences in social issues.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>It was this willingness—and in many cases eagerness—to engage with social issues that ultimately planted the seeds of the project’s demise. Since its inception, it had operated under increasingly severe financial limitations, as well as hostility from certain members of Congress and sections of the press opposed to Roosevelt’s New Deal. Although it survived drastic budget cuts in 1937, its treatment of social issues served to intensify the opposition through the gaze of the House of Un-American Activities Committee. The project had become a political issue and, as support waned, a 1939 Congressional hearing cut funding completely—a final curtain call for the project after four years.</span></span></p>","id":589,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":748,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/357abe7ee6e50da0a9ec260645cf3dde.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/357abe7ee6e50da0a9ec260645cf3dde.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/357abe7ee6e50da0a9ec260645cf3dde.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/357abe7ee6e50da0a9ec260645cf3dde.jpg"}}],"id":589,"caption":"<p>Courtesy of <span>George Mason University Libraries Special Collections &amp; Archives.<span><br /></span></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Public domain.

Its programs paved the way for predecessor organizations like the American Negro Theatre, which grew out of the disbanded Negro Theatre Project. This group would train a new generation of actors like Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, and Ruby Dee, who would become fixtures on American stage and screen in later decades and would be known particularly for their investment in exploring race and inequality. The tensions between FTP theatre professionals and Congress around social issues in art foreshadowed the intrusions of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings into the lives and works of playwrights and other artists in the 1950s. As its impact demonstrates, the Federal Theatre Project was a powerful and influential movement that altered the landscape of post-Depression-era American theater through its innovative productions and ideas about how theatre can engage national and local audiences.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>","id":613,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":784,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/b968c17ec2d99f5ca16a96968bd2ac5d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/b968c17ec2d99f5ca16a96968bd2ac5d.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/b968c17ec2d99f5ca16a96968bd2ac5d.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/b968c17ec2d99f5ca16a96968bd2ac5d.tif"}}],"id":613,"caption":"<p><span>7 Stages Theatre (Atlanta, Ga.)

Newly invigorated performing arts costume and set designers worked within the material and financial limitations of New York's regenerating theatre industry and depressed economy. The heavy-handed decorative design and hyperrealism of pre-war theatre began to fade as the high costs of supplies and labor forced this new cohort of young designers to develop a more economic design aesthetic. They became more interested in creating true-to-story artistic fantasies in which costumes and sets worked together and did not impede the progression of the production. English director and designer, Edward Gordon Craig, was a leader in the early twentieth-century movement against stark realism in theatre design. His ideas, which rose to popularity in the 1920s, emphasized artistic fantasy and originality while promoting production design that would reflect and convey a story.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the period leading up to the stock market crash of October 1929, theatre was the most popular form of U.S. entertainment. In 1927 alone, Broadway debuted 250 shows and estimates place audience attendance in New York City at 20 million people at a time when New York’s resident and visiting populations were a fraction of what they are today. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, new theatre establishments provided great opportunity for vaudeville and musicals to emerge, as innovative boundary-crossing works were produced for stages across the country.  </span></span></p>","id":577,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":762,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/d18217e3af89dde2da0cec90b520d5d9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/d18217e3af89dde2da0cec90b520d5d9.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/d18217e3af89dde2da0cec90b520d5d9.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/d18217e3af89dde2da0cec90b520d5d9.jpg"}}],"id":577,"caption":"<p>Copyright the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. </p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"University of Virginia Drama","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"1cff476e1d7379ba2541b736a4626c3e","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":810977}}]},{"text":null,"id":578,"order":3,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":763,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/1c764e0de4c1882946f86219342a9dcb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/1c764e0de4c1882946f86219342a9dcb.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/1c764e0de4c1882946f86219342a9dcb.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/1c764e0de4c1882946f86219342a9dcb.jpg"}}],"id":578,"caption":"<p><span>\"Queen Elizabeth Receives the Explorers\" in Durwood Barbour Collection of North Carolina Postcards (P077), North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives, Wilson Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. Public domain.</span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"This item is presented courtesy of the North Carolina Collection, UNC-Chapel Hill, for research and educational purposes.
