It was not until Lyman Blake's sole sewing machine in 1858, however, that uppers were stitched to soles at an industry pace with the high quality of hand-stitching. Blake sold his design to Gordon McKay, who improved its mechanics and marketed it widely.</span></p>\n<p><span>A Massachusetts-born engineer, McKay used the urgent demand for outfitting soldiers during the Civil War as impetus to get his patent accepted quickly and his sewing machine put to use on a wide scale. Unlike those of many wartime manufacturers, McKay’s business saw a successful afterlife following the war. He was able to lease his abundance of machines to shoe manufacturers, who in turn gave him a royalty on each pair of shoes made. By the century’s end, the invention was responsible for the production of some 120 million pairs of shoes per year.</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1716,"caption":"<p>Image of Lyman Blake from <em>A short history of American shoemaking</em>, 1912.
