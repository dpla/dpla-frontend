But many were indeed preserved and remain as parks today.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>As cities have continued to expand, in recent decades the issues of preservation and public access have reached suburban and exurban areas as well, leading to the development of county and regional park systems.</span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1248,"caption":"<p><span><span>This 1916 map of the Minneapolis, Minnesota park system shows the effort park planners put into acquiring almost all of the waterfront property along the Mississippi River, Minnehaha Creek, and multiple lakes, ensuring that these areas remain part of the public trust to this day.  Courtesy of the Minneapolis Park &amp; Recreation Board via Minnesota Digital Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":812012,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812012"}},{"id":1248,"caption":"<p><span><span>This 1916 map of the Minneapolis, Minnesota park system shows the effort park planners put into acquiring almost all of the waterfront property along the Mississippi River, Minnehaha Creek, and multiple lakes, ensuring that these areas remain part of the public trust to this day.  Courtesy of the Minneapolis Park &amp; Recreation Board via Minnesota Digital Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":812012,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812012"},"files":[{"id":2827,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/2827","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/7cf9f1654e736854d10e61a027a4078b.jpg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/7cf9f1654e736854d10e61a027a4078b.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/7cf9f1654e736854d10e61a027a4078b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/7cf9f1654e736854d10e61a027a4078b.jpg"},"added":"2015-08-29T09:05:55+00:00","modified":"2017-10-11T05:22:46+00:00","filename":"7cf9f1654e736854d10e61a027a4078b.jpg","authentication":"3fb6eb216ca26e8bf50e9a52c866a8e2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Minneapolis.jpg","size":18820496,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1},"iptc":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001B%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20150604"],"DigitalCreationTime":["093927-0500"]}}},"item":{"id":812012,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812012","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":1249,"page_id":516,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1249,"caption":"<p><span><span>An image of Congdon Park from </span><span>Duluth</span><span>, a 1916 promotional booklet featuring the city's parks alongside its industries, infrastructure and other resources.

Some historians state that these sorts of controls had the effect of discouraging park use by the working class and immigrant people for whom the idealistic planners had said the parks were intended.</p>\n<p>But people kept coming to parks, using them in their preferred ways, and making requests for facilities to meet their needs until park planners were compelled to accommodate the growing demand for more active park uses.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1251,"caption":"<p><span><span>\"A Stroll in Central Park.\" Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":812015,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812015"}},{"id":1251,"caption":"<p><span><span>\"A Stroll in Central Park.\" Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":812015,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812015"},"files":[{"id":2825,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/2825","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/876b38a3c7144673f6247c5f307c2520.png","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/876b38a3c7144673f6247c5f307c2520.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/876b38a3c7144673f6247c5f307c2520.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/876b38a3c7144673f6247c5f307c2520.jpg"},"added":"2015-08-28T12:16:35+00:00","modified":"2015-08-28T12:16:35+00:00","filename":"876b38a3c7144673f6247c5f307c2520.png","authentication":"eb5d8149126df9b3c6552cad1b2722f7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/png","order":null,"original_filename":"Stroll.png","size":217647,"stored":true,"type_os":"PNG image data, 349 x 581, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/png","video":{"dataformat":"png","lossless":false,"resolution_x":349,"resolution_y":581,"bits_per_sample":32,"compression_ratio":0.26834353377489},"comments":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"XMP Core 5.4.0\">\n   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\">\n      <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\"\n            xmlns:exif=\"http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/\"\n            xmlns:tiff=\"http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/\">\n         <exif:PixelYDimension>581</exif:PixelYDimension>\n         <exif:PixelXDimension>349</exif:PixelXDimension>\n         <tiff:Orientation>1</tiff:Orientation>\n      </rdf:Description>\n   </rdf:RDF>\n</x:xmpmeta>"]},"comments_html":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=&quot;adobe:ns:meta/&quot; x:xmptk=&quot;XMP Core 5.4.0&quot;&gt;&#10;   &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;&quot;&#10;            xmlns:exif=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/&quot;&#10;            xmlns:tiff=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/&quot;&gt;&#10;         &lt;exif:PixelYDimension&gt;581&lt;/exif:PixelYDimension&gt;&#10;         &lt;exif:PixelXDimension&gt;349&lt;/exif:PixelXDimension&gt;&#10;         &lt;tiff:Orientation&gt;1&lt;/tiff:Orientation&gt;&#10;      &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;&#10;   &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;&#10;&lt;/x:xmpmeta&gt;"]}},"item":{"id":812015,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/812015","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":1252,"page_id":517,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1252,"caption":"<p><span><span>Families picnicking in a park in Coalville, Utah, ca. 1900.
