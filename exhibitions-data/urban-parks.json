          "text": "<p>In 1853, the City of New York set aside hundreds of acres of swampland in the middle of Manhattan, with the idea that this uninhabitable space could serve a practical, public purpose. Today, we know that area as Central Park, one of the most widely visited and celebrated public spaces in the country. The then-unknown park designer who won the bid to design Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted, would go on to inspire and revolutionize urban park design in the United States. The work of Olmsted and other early parks pioneers, building on older concepts like town squares, would spur the growth of urban parks large and small nationwide.</p>\n<p>Benefiting from new innovations in design, these parks serve as community centers and defining features of cities and towns across the country. Urban parks have continually adapted to meet the needs of the publics they serve, evolving, for example, from places to simply enjoy nature into recreation sites that offer activities and equipment. More than just sites for leisure, they also play a broader role in supporting community engagement by providing places for civic participation, enhancing quality of life and property values, and offering safe, healthy, and convenient recreation options.</p>",

Passive recreation often makes use of the open space and scenic aspects of a park in relatively quiet and low intensity ways and might require amenities like paths, benches, and rustic picnic tables. Active recreation often involves cooperative or team activity, might be somewhat noisy and might require facilities like playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, or the like. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul><p><span><span>Attitudes around these elements shifted through time, and their implementation in any particular design was affected by factors like type, size, or location of a park.

Funds were not always available to accomplish all the desired elements at once. Dredging lakes, draining marshes, and re-grading terrain were significant undertakings. And trees, shrubs, and other plantings take years to grow into the lovely landscaping intended by the designer.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>But with time the various elements and features come together to make a pleasant, inviting park setting for community use. It is interesting to note how regional differences in natural resources, geography and landscape options lead to tangible differences in park designs, building materials and recreational features.</span></span></p>",

Emerging towns in frontier America would boast of their parks in promotional materials designed to lure investors and settlers from the East. The wide array of early postcards depicting local parks is additional evidence of communities' pride in them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Urban parks are typically open, public places that can hold many people at once. These features have led them to be put to use as formal and informal gathering spaces, for civic or community events, and for planned or spontaneous events. Parks have even been put to unexpected dramatic use in times of crisis as as a place for people to gather and for authorities to provide services to those in need.</span></p>\n<p><span>Much as early promoters touted many social and economic benefits of parks, advocates today cite impacts like the following:</span></p>\n<ul><li>\n<p><span>Parks attract non-resident visitors who put new dollars into local economies.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Proximity to parks and open space enhances the value of residential properties and produces increased tax revenues for communities.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Open space captures precipitation, reduces stormwater management costs, and protects underground water sources that often provide drinking water.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Trees and shrubs reduce air pollution control costs.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><span>Parks provide habitat for wildlife.</span></li>\n</ul>",

This led to a progression of types that can be described chronologically, but it is important to note that new types of parks emerged alongside existing ones, so that multiple types exist concurrently. Also, an established park may evolve to meet the changing needs of its users, taking on characteristics more common in another category of park, as in the case of a playground being added to a cultural park.</p>\n<p>Parks require oversight and maintenance. Larger communities with multiple parks are likely to administer parks as a system, thinking about each park in relation to the others and in relation to the needs of the community as a whole, combining types and approaches to most fully address those needs.</p>",

Urbanization led to congestion and over-crowded housing for workers while industrialization led to pollution and fatigue. Reformers seeking ways to address these societal and health issues called for public parks as one approach. Parks would provide open green space where everyone, regardless of class, could escape the noise and pollution of the city.</span></p>\n<p><span>To this end, in 1853, authorization was given to the City of New York for the purchase of a huge swath of land in central Manhattan. Filled with marshes and rocky outcroppings, the parcel would not have been attractive for commercial or agricultural development. In fact, when the park was eventually developed, topsoil had to be carted in from New Jersey as the existing soil would not have supported trees and shrubs.</span></p>\n<p><span>A contest for the design of the park was won in 1858 by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Their submission was notable for the way it combined formal and naturalistic settings with architectural flourishes like Bethesda Terrace and the ornate bridges that circulated traffic through the park.</span></p>\n<p><span>Construction and landscaping took fifteen years. Over the years elements such as a zoo, museums and recreational facilities were added as the park was shaped by the public that used it.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Central Park, more than 150 years old, receives more than 35 million visitors annually and is an iconic and beloved feature of New York City.</span></span></p>",

He did not attend college but rather worked in a wide variety of occupations - seaman, merchant, farmer, journalist and editor.</span></p>\n<p><span>A journey to Europe to visit many grand parks and a friendship with Andrew Jackson Dowling, a prominent landscape designer, built his interest in parks and their role in an urban society. In 1857, he and Calvert Vaux, an English architect, submitted a design proposal for New York's Central Park and were awarded the commission. The partners coined the term \"landscape architect\" and the influential Central Park project launched a long and prolific career for Olmsted.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to designing parks throughout the country, Olmsted also completed plans for the grounds of academic institutions, hospitals, zoos, cemeteries, country estates, the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and the US Capitol. During the Civil War he served as executive director of the US Sanitary Commission, a precursor to the Red Cross. His appreciation of landscape and scenic views led to an influential role in the conservation movement, including advocacy for the preservation of natural wonders like Niagara Falls and Yosemite.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Frederick Law Olmsted died in 1903.</span></span></p>",

His services were in high demand and his firm was involved in the design of nearly 500 projects in forty-five states and several countries, 100 of which were for parks and recreation grounds.</span></p>\n<p><span>He worked on a wide variety of park projects around the country. In addition to Central Park he designed other large urban parks devoted (initially, at least) to the experience of scenery like Elm Park in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Franklin Park (part of Olmsted’s Emerald Necklace park system) in Boston, Massachusetts.</span></p>\n<p><span>Parkways were an innovation proposed by Olmsted. He envisioned wide urban greenways carrying several different modes of transportation, connecting parks and extending the benefits of public greenspace throughout the city. Examples of his parkway design include the parkway system in Brooklyn, New York, Martin Luther King Boulevard in Chicago, and the oldest example in Buffalo, New York.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>He was also one of the first park designers to think of parks as a system, with a variety of park spaces and sizes offering a wide range of public recreation facilities for all residents in a city.</span></span></p>",

Originally established on the edges of urban areas in the late 1800s or early 1900s, these were large regional parks or pleasure grounds generally built on what were then the outer reaches of town, where extensive swaths of undeveloped land were still available and reasonably affordable.</span></p>\n<p><span>Responding to concerns about urbanization and industrialization, park designers often strove to replicate a rural setting to provide an opportunity for park users living far away from the country to have a restorative retreat from the city. Thus groves of trees, rolling meadows, lakes and meandering paths were common features.</span></p>\n<p><span>As the cities grew to encompass the parks that had once been somewhat remote, and as park users made their interests and preferences known, social and cultural attractions were often added. Zoos, formal gardens, music pavilions, museums, and theatrical venues were all features of what became known as cultural parks.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>New York's Central Park was the seminal example of a city park and was admired and emulated by other cities around the nation.</span></span></p>",

Growing cities were enfolding the \"rural\" parks built on what had once been their outskirts, the well-to-do were building stately homes around the now-desireable park locations, and civic leaders felt that working people rarely visited the large parks because of strenuous work schedules and the difficulties of traveling long distances. </span></p>\n<p><span>It was also believed that the proper \"ventilation\" of a city was a primary factor in the health of its residents. Parks and open spaces served as lungs generating \"currents of air which sweep through neighboring streets cooling the atmosphere and raising noxious effluvia out of harm's way.\" (E. R. L. Gould, \"Park Areas and Open Spaces in Cities,\" 1888.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Social and health concerns such as these led many cities to devote resources to creating smaller neighborhood parks that would provide easy access to open or recreational space in order to \"recuperate waning energies by physical exercise or quiet rest in the midst of delightful surroundings.\" (E. R. L. Gould) </span></p>\n<p><span><span>In Minneapolis, Minnesota, for example, park planners decided that no resident should be further than six blocks from a public park. Residents were typically pleased to support park creation as it increased their property values, as well as providing attractive recreational space.</span></span></p>",

Creative approaches included pocket parks, parks built over roadways, and publicly accessible green space on private property.</span></p>\n<p><span>Coined in the 1960s, the term “pocket parks” refers to small (generally smaller than a quarter of an acre), publicly accessible areas that often provide greenery, a place to sit outdoors, and sometimes a playground for children. They may be created on vacant building lots or as part of a large building development’s public space requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>One example is Freeway Park, which opened in 1976 in downtown Seattle, Washington. It links multiple small pockets of space to create an interesting park complex. The park extends over and around an interstate and large public parking lot, using fountains, greenery, and linked plazas to draw together neighborhoods previously divided by the freeway.</span></span></p>",

It may have initially served as a shared pasture. As towns grew, the square evolved into a park or plaza in front of the original county courthouse or town hall. It often included a monument, fountain, or flagpole to reflect its role in the civic life of the community. Some town squares also served as a market or commercial gathering space.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Town squares hosted civic gatherings, parades, and other community events, as well as serving as informal meeting or recreational space. As city centers became more dedicated to commerce, and as cars came to dominate the urban landscape in the twentieth century, many town squares were reduced to make room for wider roads or parking, or were redeveloped altogether.</span></span></p>",

Concerns grew about unsupervised children playing in the streets, disrupting traffic and sometimes actually being killed. Arguments were raised in favor of playground and recreation spaces that would provide places where children could have the benefit of pure air and be free from the “dangers and pernicious influence of the streets.” Some early park administrators felt that playgrounds would be too noisy, or that children would not behave with appropriate respect toward park grounds and facilities, but by the 1920s, playgrounds began to appear in park plans.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Many early park playgrounds included equipment for younger children such as swings, “teeters,” and “sand pits” but much of the equipment was actually intended for older children and youth, such as high bars, pommel horses, rings, and other items that required some gymnastic training and supervision.</span></span></p>",

Demand from park users for such facilities began to rise in many areas of the country in the 1920s and 1930s. Playground advocates had focused largely on the needs of children, but with the expansion in recreation programs, park administrators observed dramatic increases in adult participation in park activities.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Fields and courts for sports like tennis, baseball, and football were included in park plans to support informal play as well as organized league play. Many parks provided field houses or recreation buildings for indoor activities, and more specialized facilities for activities like horseshoes, shuffleboard, or croquet. Wading and swimming pools were also a popular recreation feature of municipal parks and some cities were able to build golf courses as part of their park system.</span></span></p>",

Picnic pavilions, restrooms, and recreation buildings became important features starting in the early twentieth century as parks began to accommodate more active uses.</span></p>\n<p><span>Infrastructure elements such as roads, bridges, or walls made up a large part of construction and maintenance expenses for park administrators.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Cultural parks might include more elaborate or extensive buildings for features like museums, conservatories, and zoos. Structures like these were often added to existing parks as their role changed from a restful rural retreat on the edge of town to more of an event and gathering place. An example of such a park is Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California.</span></span></p>",
