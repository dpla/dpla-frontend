The story a visitor to an exhibit ends up hearing, of course, is dependent upon who is telling the story and the slant of their own perspective. When the subject of the exhibit is Native Americans in the Upper Midwestern United States during the extraordinary upheaval of the 19th century, one must be particularly careful about the story being told since the narrative that largely exists is one of cultural denouement, of endings, as told by a colonizing population to its descendants.</p>\n<p>The dominant narrative of the demise of traditional Native American culture in the face of colonization, conversion to Christianity, confinement to reservations and economic collapse is, however, not the only story that can be told. The accounts of the lives of Native Americans during the 19th century that are told by Native peoples themselves are strikingly different to those recounted in history books, movies, and all too frequently in museums. Rather than narratives solely recounting destruction and demise, Native stories about Native history tend to focus on what White Earth Ojibwe scholar Gerald Vizenor has called survivance – a narrative incorporating themes of survival and resistance that insist on the inclusion of the Native presence.</p>\n<p>The following is an exhibit of resources that can be found within the Digital Public Library of America retold through the lens of Native American survivance in the Minnesota region. Within are a series of objects of both Native and non-Native origin that tell a story of extraordinary culture disruption, change and continuity during 19th c., and how that affects the Native population of Minnesota today.</p>","id":338,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":390,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/e7a1da5abaf2ae2acfc38d4004bcd592.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/e7a1da5abaf2ae2acfc38d4004bcd592.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/e7a1da5abaf2ae2acfc38d4004bcd592.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/e7a1da5abaf2ae2acfc38d4004bcd592.tif"}}],"id":338,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Dakota quillwork leather vest, a<span>pproximately 1890-1899.

Like the Anishinaabe tradition of wild ricing, pipestone has religious origins for Dakota people – it’s said to have been made from the flesh and blood of the ancestral Dakota who did not survive a great flood. From the archaeological record, it’s known that Dakota people have quarried the stone since at least 1200 AD.

While the most common form of catlinite pipe on the eastern Plains is a simple “elbow” shape, there is a long tradition of elaborately carved pipe bowls, particularly those in the form of horses. This circa 1860 pipe is, however, unique in its subject matter – that of a Civil War-era American soldier in a short-brimmed cap, piped jacket and pants, and fitted boots. The ferrule is delicately inlaid with lead in a cross-hatched pattern that is echoed in both the figure’s boots and hat.</p>\n<p> </p>","id":528,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":385,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/32912fe3c3329534409b6c3dc4387e71.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/32912fe3c3329534409b6c3dc4387e71.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/32912fe3c3329534409b6c3dc4387e71.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/32912fe3c3329534409b6c3dc4387e71.tif"}}],"id":528,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Band of Dakota Indians at the Pipestone Quarry, Pipestone County, Minnesota.</p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Band of Dakota Indians at the Pipestone Quarry, Pipestone County, Minnesota","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"5c23093bf69c1aac8a0ecc6d84a08c76","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Pipestone County Historical Society, Pipestone, Minnesota","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Band of Dakota Native Americans at the Pipestone Quarry, near Pipestone, Minnesota.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Minnesota Digital Library","element":{"name":"Source","id":48},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Pipestone County Historical Society, 113 South Hiawatha Avenue, Pipestone, MN 56164; http://pipestoneminnesota.com/museum/","element":{"name":"Source","id":48},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"7/8/1905","element":{"name":"Date","id":40},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"mhs02544.tif","element":{"name":"Identifier","id":43},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"http://reflections.mndigital.org/cdm/ref/collection/pipe/id/17","element":{"name":"Is Part Of","id":70},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"http://54.245.164.12:3000/mdl/items/mhs02544.tif","element":{"name":"Original Format","id":7},"element_set":{"name":"Item Type Metadata","id":3},"html":false}],"id":810586}}]},{"text":null,"id":529,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":380,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/c47828ea76f2e3fe1d58528f9c260332.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/c47828ea76f2e3fe1d58528f9c260332.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/c47828ea76f2e3fe1d58528f9c260332.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/c47828ea76f2e3fe1d58528f9c260332.tif"}}],"id":529,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Pipestone/catlinite pipe.</p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Pipestone/catlinite pipe","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"5283c48d2b500456cf0e7770655b9d24","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"http://www.mnhs.org/mhsuse.html","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Catlinite pipe carved in the form of a white man in 1840s attire resting on his arms and lower back, with his legs raised.

An astonishing osmosis of traditional Native objects occurred from the western frontier to east coast museums as souvenirs of a dying race. The diminution of traditional Native objects as tourist goods for trade to Victorian women was common as White tourists increasingly flocked to Native places, believing Native people to be on the brink of extinction.</p>\n<p>Present in this particular photograph are a wealth of Anishinaabe made objects including bandolier bags, dance aprons, wall pockets, garters, belts, knife cases and a ceremonial drum, all displayed in a Victorian parlor. Several of these objects are identifiable and currently in the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul.</p>\n<p>One example is the extraordinary bandolier bag that can be seen in the far left of the first photo. The beadwork on Anishinaabe bandolier bags can be either stitched or loomed, or a combination of the two. The beadwork featured on the strap and body of this bag was created on a loom and then applied to the woolen fabric of the bag. The geometric designs likely pre-date the florals that Ojibwe beadworkers are famed for, and may in fact be an echo of the symbols of state produced during the hierarchical Mississippian Chiefdoms to the southeast.</p>\n<p>Older art traditions struggled but coexisted with newer ones during the Reservation Period.

Porcupine quilling is an extremely labor-intensive art that pre-existed the importation of European-made glass beads in the early 19th century.</p>\n<p>Men also produced artwork intended to appeal to non-Natives. Men were traditionally responsible for sculptural art, an occupation that continued well into the 20th century. Here, the form of a gunstock club (a type of war club made from the hardwood stock of a Western rifle) has been carved in miniature out of pipestone, decoratively engraved, and transformed into a paperweight – something the Dakota themselves had no use for, but which was observed being used among Americans.</p>","id":560,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":347,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/7d42c8508c7587f6d703e387cf3d3bd5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/7d42c8508c7587f6d703e387cf3d3bd5.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/7d42c8508c7587f6d703e387cf3d3bd5.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/7d42c8508c7587f6d703e387cf3d3bd5.tif"}}],"id":560,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">American Indian collection of Mrs. Jessie C.

Thought to have originated circa 1900 with the Minnesota Ojibwe at Red Lake or Mille Lacs, the dress is said to have its origins in a vision given to a Midewiwin practitioner of a dress that would heal both the women who danced it and the communities they danced for.
