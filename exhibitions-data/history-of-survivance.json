Pipestone, also called catlinite (named after American artist George Catlin, who painted a canvas of the area in 1836,) is a soft red rock that is traditionally used for carving pipe bowls. Like the Anishinaabe tradition of wild ricing, pipestone has religious origins for Dakota people – it’s said to have been made from the flesh and blood of the ancestral Dakota who did not survive a great flood. From the archaeological record, it’s known that Dakota people have quarried the stone since at least 1200 AD.

They were hanged in a public square in Mankato on December 26, 1862 – to this day, the largest mass execution in American history.</p>\n<p>It is only very, very recently that the dominant culture has been willing to hear the Native side of the story with regard to the final breakdown of communication that led to the 1862 US-Dakota War. Memorials to the Euro-American settlers and soldiers who lost their lives during the six week long conflict dot the southern third of the state, but there are no monuments to the Native dead. Indeed, it was only in 1972 that the city of Mankato removed a plaque that lauded the mass execution of 38 Dakota men for their participation in the war. In 1992 the city renamed the site of the execution Reconciliation Park.</p>\n<p> </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":544,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Execution of the 38 Dakota at Mankato, Minnesota, December 26, 1862.</p>","item":{"id":810568,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810568"}},{"id":544,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Execution of the 38 Dakota at Mankato, Minnesota, December 26, 1862.</p>","item":{"id":810568,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810568"},"files":[{"id":369,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/369","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/cbb68901d2648e05f76de5ceeb15ce04.tif","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/cbb68901d2648e05f76de5ceeb15ce04.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/cbb68901d2648e05f76de5ceeb15ce04.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/cbb68901d2648e05f76de5ceeb15ce04.jpg"},"added":"2013-03-20T07:33:27+00:00","modified":"2020-02-07T12:33:32+00:00","filename":"cbb68901d2648e05f76de5ceeb15ce04.tif","authentication":"42ff627cd35738c8b20901310f25cef8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/tiff","order":null,"original_filename":"http://54.245.164.12:3000/mdl/items/615.tif","size":19746642,"stored":true,"type_os":"TIFF image data, little-endian","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/tiff","video":{"dataformat":"tiff","lossless":true,"resolution_x":3000,"resolution_y":2191,"bits_per_sample":24,"codec":"Uncompressed","compression_ratio":1.0014017952229},"comments":{"make":["NIKON CORPORATION"],"model":["NIKON D2Xs"],"software":["Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Windows"],"datetime":["2011:11:02 12:54:39"]},"comments_html":{"make":["NIKON CORPORATION"],"model":["NIKON D2Xs"],"software":["Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Windows"],"datetime":["2011:11:02 12:54:39"]}},"item":{"id":810568,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810568","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":545,"page_id":279,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":545,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Dakota Conflict Monument at Lake Shetek, Shetek, Minnesota.</p>","item":{"id":810549,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810549"}},{"id":545,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Dakota Conflict Monument at Lake Shetek, Shetek, Minnesota.</p>","item":{"id":810549,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810549"},"files":[{"id":351,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/351","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/450e8305122ce28dbb855bf218cae74c.tif","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/450e8305122ce28dbb855bf218cae74c.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/450e8305122ce28dbb855bf218cae74c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/450e8305122ce28dbb855bf218cae74c.jpg"},"added":"2013-03-20T07:14:47+00:00","modified":"2020-02-07T12:18:41+00:00","filename":"450e8305122ce28dbb855bf218cae74c.tif","authentication":"03b183d63e95d7d71a1f5a5f70e25663","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/tiff","order":null,"original_filename":"http://54.245.164.12:3000/mdl/items/mhs12818.tif","size":32702528,"stored":true,"type_os":"TIFF image data, little-endian","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/tiff","video":{"dataformat":"tiff","lossless":true,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3857,"bits_per_sample":24,"codec":"Uncompressed","compression_ratio":1.0007964132271},"comments":{"software":["Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Macintosh)"],"datetime":["2013:03:14 10:42:40"]},"comments_html":{"software":["Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Macintosh)"],"datetime":["2013:03:14 10:42:40"]}},"item":{"id":810549,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/810549","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":286,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/exhibit_pages/286","title":"Art for Sale","slug":"art-for-sale","order":3,"exhibit":{"id":22,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/exhibits/22"},"parent":{"id":211,"resource":"exhibit_pages","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/exhibit_pages/211"},"page_blocks":[{"id":556,"page_id":286,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":"<p><span>As the pressures of colonization continued into the late 19</span><span>th</span><span> and early 20</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, Native Americans began to respond with objects made specifically in an effort to participate in the changing economy.

The beadwork featured on the strap and body of this bag was created on a loom and then applied to the woolen fabric of the bag.

Men were traditionally responsible for sculptural art, an occupation that continued well into the 20th century. Here, the form of a gunstock club (a type of war club made from the hardwood stock of a Western rifle) has been carved in miniature out of pipestone, decoratively engraved, and transformed into a paperweight – something the Dakota themselves had no use for, but which was observed being used among Americans.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":560,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">American Indian collection of Mrs. Jessie C.

Several of these objects are identifiable and currently in the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul.</p>\n<p>One example is the extraordinary bandolier bag that can be seen in the far left of the first photo. The beadwork on Anishinaabe bandolier bags can be either stitched or loomed, or a combination of the two. The beadwork featured on the strap and body of this bag was created on a loom and then applied to the woolen fabric of the bag. The geometric designs likely pre-date the florals that Ojibwe beadworkers are famed for, and may in fact be an echo of the symbols of state produced during the hierarchical Mississippian Chiefdoms to the southeast.</p>\n<p>Older art traditions struggled but coexisted with newer ones during the Reservation Period. This fully-quilled leather vest was made by a Dakota woman in Minnesota at approximately the same time the mixed lace vest was created. Porcupine quilling is an extremely labor-intensive art that pre-existed the importation of European-made glass beads in the early 19th century.</p>\n<p>Men also produced artwork intended to appeal to non-Natives. Men were traditionally responsible for sculptural art, an occupation that continued well into the 20th century. Here, the form of a gunstock club (a type of war club made from the hardwood stock of a Western rifle) has been carved in miniature out of pipestone, decoratively engraved, and transformed into a paperweight – something the Dakota themselves had no use for, but which was observed being used among Americans.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":560,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">American Indian collection of Mrs. Jessie C.
