The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad had dire consequences for the native tribes of the Great Plains, forever altering the landscape and causing the disappearance of once-reliable wild game. The railroad was probably the single biggest contributor to the loss of the bison, which was particularly traumatic to the Plains tribes who depended on it for everything from meat for food to skins and fur for clothing, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tribes increasingly came into conflict with the railroad as they attempted to defend their diminishing resources. Additionally, the railroad brought white homesteaders who farmed the newly tamed land that had been the bison’s domain. Tribes of the Plains found themselves at cultural odds with the whites building the railroad and settlers claiming ownership over land that had previously never been owned. In response, Native Americans sabotaged the railroad and attacked white settlements supported by the line, in an attempt to reclaim the way of life that was being taken from them. If they were not taking aim at the railroad tracks and machinery, they would attack the workers and abscond with their livestock. Ultimately the tribes of the Plains were unsuccessful in preventing the loss of their territory and hunting resources.

The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad had dire consequences for the native tribes of the Great Plains, forever altering the landscape and causing the disappearance of once-reliable wild game. The railroad was probably the single biggest contributor to the loss of the bison, which was particularly traumatic to the Plains tribes who depended on it for everything from meat for food to skins and fur for clothing, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tribes increasingly came into conflict with the railroad as they attempted to defend their diminishing resources. Additionally, the railroad brought white homesteaders who farmed the newly tamed land that had been the bison’s domain. Tribes of the Plains found themselves at cultural odds with the whites building the railroad and settlers claiming ownership over land that had previously never been owned. In response, Native Americans sabotaged the railroad and attacked white settlements supported by the line, in an attempt to reclaim the way of life that was being taken from them. If they were not taking aim at the railroad tracks and machinery, they would attack the workers and abscond with their livestock. Ultimately the tribes of the Plains were unsuccessful in preventing the loss of their territory and hunting resources. Their struggle serves as a poignant example of how the Transcontinental Railroad could simultaneously destroy one way of life as it ushered in another.</span> </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":937,"caption":"<p><span><span>“Cheyenne Indians tearing up the tracks of the Union Pacific R.R.” Courtesy of the Utah State Historical Society via the Mountain West Digital Library. </span></span></p>","item":{"id":811430,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811430"},"file":{"id":1252,"resource":"files","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/1252"}},{"id":937,"caption":"<p><span><span>“Cheyenne Indians tearing up the tracks of the Union Pacific R.R.” Courtesy of the Utah State Historical Society via the Mountain West Digital Library. </span></span></p>","item":{"id":811430,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811430"},"file":{"id":1252,"resource":"files","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/1252"},"files":[{"id":1252,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/1252","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/89905233fb21a520a06144d0f424d7c1.png","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/89905233fb21a520a06144d0f424d7c1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/89905233fb21a520a06144d0f424d7c1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/89905233fb21a520a06144d0f424d7c1.jpg"},"added":"2015-05-03T14:12:44+00:00","modified":"2018-06-12T21:11:08+00:00","filename":"89905233fb21a520a06144d0f424d7c1.png","authentication":"9273b9f6a594a56af5e79b7e8a2baaf1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/144273204/Railroad/4404636d9ae9202570540efb347e3c94.png","size":1991534,"stored":true,"type_os":"PNG image data, 1731 x 1191, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/png","video":{"dataformat":"png","lossless":false,"resolution_x":1731,"resolution_y":1191,"bits_per_sample":32,"compression_ratio":0.24150098393449},"comments":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"XMP Core 5.4.0\">\n   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\">\n      <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\"\n            xmlns:tiff=\"http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/\">\n         <tiff:Orientation>1</tiff:Orientation>\n      </rdf:Description>\n   </rdf:RDF>\n</x:xmpmeta>"]},"comments_html":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=&quot;adobe:ns:meta/&quot; x:xmptk=&quot;XMP Core 5.4.0&quot;&gt;&#10;   &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;&quot;&#10;            xmlns:tiff=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/&quot;&gt;&#10;         &lt;tiff:Orientation&gt;1&lt;/tiff:Orientation&gt;&#10;      &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;&#10;   &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;&#10;&lt;/x:xmpmeta&gt;"]}},"item":{"id":811430,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811430","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":938,"page_id":427,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":938,"caption":"<p><span><span>A Native American family pictured next to a steam locomotive, late 1890s.

Arguably its greatest contribution was that it allowed for people and goods to travel from coast to coast at unprecedented speeds. Prior to construction, cross-country travel required long treks over dangerous land and sea. Travelers could trek for months across the American interior, over the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountains, and on through the Sierra Nevadas, before ever reaching California. Even by sea, migrants had to spend several weeks sailing around South America and the treacherous Cape Horn before reaching San Francisco. Whereas countless lives were lost by land and by sea, the railroad expedited cross-country travel and made it safer for westward expansion.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Transcontinental Railroad also served as a strong symbol of American achievement. This was important as the country continued to rebuild after the Civil War. Not only had the US built a transportation system that enabled travel “from sea to shining sea,” but it had also conquered the terrain and the elements of a still wild West. As the country set forth united, railroad workers laid the last railroad tie at Promontory Point, Utah, sealing the ceremony with a gold spike to commemorate the achievement.

Arguably its greatest contribution was that it allowed for people and goods to travel from coast to coast at unprecedented speeds. Prior to construction, cross-country travel required long treks over dangerous land and sea. Travelers could trek for months across the American interior, over the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountains, and on through the Sierra Nevadas, before ever reaching California. Even by sea, migrants had to spend several weeks sailing around South America and the treacherous Cape Horn before reaching San Francisco. Whereas countless lives were lost by land and by sea, the railroad expedited cross-country travel and made it safer for westward expansion.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Transcontinental Railroad also served as a strong symbol of American achievement. This was important as the country continued to rebuild after the Civil War. Not only had the US built a transportation system that enabled travel “from sea to shining sea,” but it had also conquered the terrain and the elements of a still wild West. As the country set forth united, railroad workers laid the last railroad tie at Promontory Point, Utah, sealing the ceremony with a gold spike to commemorate the achievement. The image of the golden spike remains one of the most iconic of the nineteenth century, although an ordinary spike did eventually replace the ceremonial gold one. In fact, the railroad had to replace ties at a rate of one per week as souvenir seekers chipped away at the railroad for a chance to own a piece of history.</span></p>\n<p> </p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":956,"caption":"<p><span><span>“The Voyage from New York to San Francisco upon the Union Pacific Railroad,” a Union Pacific Railroad Game, 1870.
