In very different ways, both candidates approached the presidency as outsiders, reaching beyond the traditional boundaries of US presidential politics. As outsiders, the 2016 candidates are noteworthy, but not unique; indeed, the 2016 race resonates with the legacies of outsiders who have come before. This exhibition explores the rich history of select individuals, parties, events, and movements that have influenced US presidential elections from the outside—outside Washington politics, outside the two-party system, and outside the traditional conception of who can be an American president.</span></p>\n<p>Outsider, in this context, requires a dynamic definition. Featured stories explore candidates who defined themselves as Washington outsiders, such as World War II general Dwight Eisenhower, yet also those who were labeled or treated as outsiders because of their race, gender, or beliefs. In 1964, Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to run for a major party’s presidential nomination.

In very different ways, both candidates approached the presidency as outsiders, reaching beyond the traditional boundaries of US presidential politics. As outsiders, the 2016 candidates are noteworthy, but not unique; indeed, the 2016 race resonates with the legacies of outsiders who have come before.

Featured stories explore candidates who defined themselves as Washington outsiders, such as World War II general Dwight Eisenhower, yet also those who were labeled or treated as outsiders because of their race, gender, or beliefs.

Appealing to resentment towards established politicians and advancing himself as a vital third candidate option, Perot campaigned on a platform that included balancing the federal budget, opposition to gun control, the end of job outsourcing, opposition to NAFTA, and popular input on government through electronic direct democracy town hall meetings. Perot challenged his supporters to petition for his name to appear on the ballot in all fifty states.</p>\n<p>After primary season in June 1992, Perot briefly led the election in polls with 39% of the popular vote over Democrat Bill Clinton and incumbent Republican George H. W. Bush. But by July 1992, Perot’s campaign faced internal challenges and Perot formally withdrew from the race. Although he re-entered on October 1, 1992, voters remained unsure whether he was officially running and his popular image was dogged by his images as a “quitter.” In spite of this turbulence, Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, from voters spread across the country as well as across party lines. Perot ran again in 1996 as the Reform Party candidate and won 8% of the popular vote. With his challenges to mainstream politics, he emerged as one of the most successful third party candidates in US history, with the most support from across the political spectrum since Theodore Roosevelt.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":2070,"caption":"<p>This 1993 video footage from the KXAS-TV/NBC station in Fort Worth, Texas, documents Ross Perot's campaign and membership drive for his organization, United We Stand America, which monitored the voting records of elected officials.

In his inaugural speech for his first term as governor in January 1963, Wallace famously advocated for “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” Television viewers around the world saw Wallace’s “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door” later that year, in which he would attempt to halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James Hood at the University of Alabama. Wallace sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1964, 1972, and 1976, but ran as a third-party candidate for the American Independent Party in 1968 with the most success.</p>\n<p>In 1968, Wallace ran on a platform similar to that of the Dixiecrats twenty years earlier that rejected the outside intervention of the federal government on civil rights issues like education while also capitalizing on reactive white fear and racism stirred up by recent civil rights gains like the Voting Rights Act, school integration, and anti-discrimination laws. In his campaign, Wallace appealed to white working and middle-class voters who feared for the safety of their jobs, neighborhoods, and schools, by positioning the oppressed and overlooked “redneck” as the new outsider displaced by federal law and black activism. In the general election, Wallace won five states—Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas—and their 46 electoral votes. More surprisingly, he won 13.5 % of the popular vote or almost 10 million votes that reflected widespread support from across the country.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":2105,"caption":"<p><span><span>In this footage from a November 4, 1968 rally in Atlanta (one day before the 1968 presidential election), candidate George Wallace responds to protestors, discusses the two-party perception of Southern “redneck” voters, and promises a shift away from federal intervention and towards state control of public education.

In his inaugural speech for his first term as governor in January 1963, Wallace famously advocated for “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” Television viewers around the world saw Wallace’s “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door” later that year, in which he would attempt to halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James Hood at the University of Alabama. Wallace sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1964, 1972, and 1976, but ran as a third-party candidate for the American Independent Party in 1968 with the most success.</p>\n<p>In 1968, Wallace ran on a platform similar to that of the Dixiecrats twenty years earlier that rejected the outside intervention of the federal government on civil rights issues like education while also capitalizing on reactive white fear and racism stirred up by recent civil rights gains like the Voting Rights Act, school integration, and anti-discrimination laws. In his campaign, Wallace appealed to white working and middle-class voters who feared for the safety of their jobs, neighborhoods, and schools, by positioning the oppressed and overlooked “redneck” as the new outsider displaced by federal law and black activism. In the general election, Wallace won five states—Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas—and their 46 electoral votes. More surprisingly, he won 13.5 % of the popular vote or almost 10 million votes that reflected widespread support from across the country.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":2105,"caption":"<p><span><span>In this footage from a November 4, 1968 rally in Atlanta (one day before the 1968 presidential election), candidate George Wallace responds to protestors, discusses the two-party perception of Southern “redneck” voters, and promises a shift away from federal intervention and towards state control of public education.

Jesse Jackson began his public career as a civil rights organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In late 1983, with decades of organizing experience but no experience in elected office, Jesse Jackson declared his candidacy for the Democratic Party’s 1984 presidential nomination. Jackson leveraged the black political mobilization of the 1970s and expanded its inclusivity, appealing to the concerns and interests of a “Rainbow Coalition” of marginalized and minority citizens, including African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, women, gay people, poor people, and more.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The Democratic Party of the early 1980s had relied on the votes of these marginalized communities, but in the view of many, fell short of making a real effort to represent them. Amidst the Reagan Revolution, which reduced government support for social and education programs and civil rights initiatives, Jesse Jackson led a grassroots campaign paired with efforts in voter registration. In doing so, he built his voter base as he went, diversified the Democratic Party, and offered a political vision inspired by the activism of the Civil Rights era and the legacy of the New Deal. Jackson did not win the nomination, but surprised many by winning five primary contests and finishing with 3.2 million votes.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the 1988 campaign, Jesse Jackson was even more successful, winning more primaries and earning broader support across both white and minority voters.

Jesse Jackson began his public career as a civil rights organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In late 1983, with decades of organizing experience but no experience in elected office, Jesse Jackson declared his candidacy for the Democratic Party’s 1984 presidential nomination. Jackson leveraged the black political mobilization of the 1970s and expanded its inclusivity, appealing to the concerns and interests of a “Rainbow Coalition” of marginalized and minority citizens, including African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, women, gay people, poor people, and more.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The Democratic Party of the early 1980s had relied on the votes of these marginalized communities, but in the view of many, fell short of making a real effort to represent them. Amidst the Reagan Revolution, which reduced government support for social and education programs and civil rights initiatives, Jesse Jackson led a grassroots campaign paired with efforts in voter registration. In doing so, he built his voter base as he went, diversified the Democratic Party, and offered a political vision inspired by the activism of the Civil Rights era and the legacy of the New Deal. Jackson did not win the nomination, but surprised many by winning five primary contests and finishing with 3.2 million votes.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the 1988 campaign, Jesse Jackson was even more successful, winning more primaries and earning broader support across both white and minority voters. Jackson also commanded greater recognition and respect from the party. Though Jackson did not win the nomination, twenty-three year old future president Barack Obama and millions of Americans watched Jackson prove that an African American could be broadly accepted as a legitimate candidate for president.</span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":2115,"caption":"<p>Jesse Jackson’s campaign was built on a foundation of grassroots organizing—reaching marginalized communities in their neighborhoods, churches, and other institutions.
