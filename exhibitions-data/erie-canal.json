A song written in New York City could be performed in Buffalo a week later. The first official song about the Canal was “Meeting of the Waters,” composed by Samuel Woodworth. It commemorates the completion and opening celebration of the Erie Canal and is dedicated to DeWitt Clinton. However, the more common entertainment on the Canal was music that could be performed on small portable instruments. Folk songs from the lumber woods and sailing ships were sometimes reworked to reflect life on the Canal. Humor was at the center of these tunes, often exaggerating the dangers of canal travel.</p>\n<p>There are many Erie Canal songs, but one popular song can be credited with making the Erie Canal world famous. “Low Bridge Everybody Down (or Fifteen Years on the Erie Canal),” was composed sometime between 1905 and 1912 by Thomas S. Allen, a songwriter for hire. F. B. Haviland Publishing Company copyrighted the song in manuscript form in 1912 and as sheet music in 1913. The release of the song near the end of the “towpath era” on the enlarged Erie Canal may help to explain both its popularity and its content.</p>\n<p> </p>","id":2255,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":3431,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/09b3026519e824604ac5e92029021810.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/09b3026519e824604ac5e92029021810.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/09b3026519e824604ac5e92029021810.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/09b3026519e824604ac5e92029021810.pdf"}}],"id":2255,"caption":"<p><span><span>This song, \"</span></span><span>The Meeting of the Waters of Hudson &amp; Erie,\" (1825) </span><span>was sung at the grand opening celebration of the Erie Canal.

Designed, financed, built, operated, and maintained by the people of New York, the canal was one of the largest public works projects ever attempted anywhere in the world when the first shovel of earth was turned near Rome, New York, on July 4, 1817. Men with talent and vision (but little training in engineering) charted the 363-mile course of the canal between Albany and Buffalo. They designed stone aqueducts to carry boats across rivers and locks to lift them over New York’s varied terrain. Thousands of laborers dug the ditch itself and built massive reservoirs to ensure the canal was constantly supplied with water. When it was completed in 1825, the Erie Canal connected the port of New York City on the Atlantic Ocean with the Great Lakes, dramatically transforming trade, industry, and communication in the region and across the country.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Erie Canal was so successful that it was enlarged three times to accommodate more traffic and increasingly larger vessels. Great cities and commerce grew along the Erie Canal. Diverse people traveled east and west across its length, some spreading powerful ideas for social change.

The wait for locks often took hours and the sizes of boats that the Canal could accommodate were severely limited. The first enlargement began in 1836, rerouting parts of the Canal and widening it to seventy feet while deepening it to seven feet. Locks were doubled to allow simultaneous two-way passage and extended in length to enable passage for larger boats. Canal construction abruptly halted in 1842 because of public reaction to a tax for public projects. However, work resumed in 1847 and, by 1862, the Enlarged Erie Canal was completed.</p>\n<p>The Barge Canal System, begun in 1907 and completed in 1918, was a result of a report from the Committee on Canals, created by New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1898. The Canal’s width was extended to 125 feet with a minimum depth of twelve feet. The towpath was eliminated because it had become obsolete with the rise of motorized vessels.
