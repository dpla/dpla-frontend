The financial investment in the Erie Canal was realized in 1834, less than ten years after the grand opening, when revenues from canal tolls exceeded eight million dollars, erasing the original construction debt.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":2242,"caption":"<p><span><span>This 1825 illustration depicts canal boats on the North River in New York. </span><span>The Dutch called what we know today as the Hudson River the \"North River\" and the Delaware River the \"South River.\" </span><span>Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814316,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814316"}},{"id":2242,"caption":"<p><span><span>This 1825 illustration depicts canal boats on the North River in New York. </span><span>The Dutch called what we know today as the Hudson River the \"North River\" and the Delaware River the \"South River.\" </span><span>Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814316,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814316"},"files":[{"id":3419,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/3419","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/51c4af20fa95cef35a5235b71bd63b52.jpg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/51c4af20fa95cef35a5235b71bd63b52.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/51c4af20fa95cef35a5235b71bd63b52.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/51c4af20fa95cef35a5235b71bd63b52.jpg"},"added":"2018-01-12T07:47:01+00:00","modified":"2018-01-14T07:36:51+00:00","filename":"51c4af20fa95cef35a5235b71bd63b52.jpg","authentication":"60df98cebbc7fd16d2c1b59879b28b1a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http://dpla-share.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/erie-exhibition/1b7e2fbb7aa4ac4910e86c12572f9c7e.jpg","size":866030,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1}},"item":{"id":814316,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814316","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":2243,"page_id":791,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":3,"attachments":[{"id":2243,"caption":"<p>This is a shipping receipt from Delahunt &amp; Co., one of many businesses that used the Erie Canal to move goods.

It took another one hundred years before the New York Corresponding Association for the Promotion of Internal Improvements was organized to advance support for building a canal across New York State—a project they envisioned as the starting point for a cross-country navigation system of waterways bridging Lake Erie with the Atlantic Ocean, the Mississippi River, and the western states of Michigan and Illinois.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":2212,"caption":"<p><span><span>This is a redraft of the Castello Plan, </span><span>one of the earliest city maps of lower Manhattan, New York, originally drafted by Jacques Cortelyou around 1660. </span><span>Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814289,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814289"}},{"id":2212,"caption":"<p><span><span>This is a redraft of the Castello Plan, </span><span>one of the earliest city maps of lower Manhattan, New York, originally drafted by Jacques Cortelyou around 1660. </span><span>Courtesy of The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814289,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814289"},"files":[{"id":3392,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/3392","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/4667c04db10f54fcb2c9751b738fa138.jpg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/4667c04db10f54fcb2c9751b738fa138.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/4667c04db10f54fcb2c9751b738fa138.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/4667c04db10f54fcb2c9751b738fa138.jpg"},"added":"2018-01-12T07:46:12+00:00","modified":"2018-01-14T07:28:18+00:00","filename":"4667c04db10f54fcb2c9751b738fa138.jpg","authentication":"299b39ceaa8dc2c595c3bad213372d2f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http://dpla-share.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/erie-exhibition/3b5c575778310ada597c936e43746f99.jpg","size":430231,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1}},"item":{"id":814289,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814289","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":2213,"page_id":779,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":3,"attachments":[{"id":2213,"caption":"<p><span><span>1817 map of the route for the Erie Canal as proposed by the New York Canal Commissioners. </span><span>Courtesy of SUNY Fredonia via Western New York Library Resources Council and Empire State Digital Network.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814290,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814290"}},{"id":2213,"caption":"<p><span><span>1817 map of the route for the Erie Canal as proposed by the New York Canal Commissioners. </span><span>Courtesy of SUNY Fredonia via Western New York Library Resources Council and Empire State Digital Network.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814290,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814290"},"files":[{"id":3393,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/3393","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/157f5a67e98106a51c842f944cd40191.jpg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/157f5a67e98106a51c842f944cd40191.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/157f5a67e98106a51c842f944cd40191.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/157f5a67e98106a51c842f944cd40191.jpg"},"added":"2018-01-12T07:46:13+00:00","modified":"2018-01-12T07:46:15+00:00","filename":"157f5a67e98106a51c842f944cd40191.jpg","authentication":"e1d6300f2146dd494a7bedd1edaa2e50","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http://dpla-share.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/erie-exhibition/50d411ad92c332295e3a40e38d95983c.jpg","size":650479,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1}},"item":{"id":814290,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814290","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":2214,"page_id":779,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":4,"attachments":[{"id":2214,"caption":"<p>This is an excerpt from an 1821 publication of the New York Corresponding Association for the Promotion of Internal Improvements, which provided the impetus for exploring a canal route connecting the western and northern lakes with the Atlantic Ocean.

With the stump puller, for example, the rate of tree stump removal jumped from four per day to forty per day.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":2238,"caption":"<p><span><span>In 1794 the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company established a rudimentary canal at Little Falls in order to overcome the treacherous geography prohibiting boat travel. </span><span>Courtesy of </span><span>The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814313,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814313"}},{"id":2238,"caption":"<p><span><span>In 1794 the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company established a rudimentary canal at Little Falls in order to overcome the treacherous geography prohibiting boat travel. </span><span>Courtesy of </span><span>The New York Public Library.</span></span></p>","item":{"id":814313,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814313"},"files":[{"id":3416,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/3416","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/e5ca2a43239d24bd6991cfa0f7736878.jpg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/e5ca2a43239d24bd6991cfa0f7736878.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/e5ca2a43239d24bd6991cfa0f7736878.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/e5ca2a43239d24bd6991cfa0f7736878.jpg"},"added":"2018-01-12T07:46:58+00:00","modified":"2018-01-14T07:35:38+00:00","filename":"e5ca2a43239d24bd6991cfa0f7736878.jpg","authentication":"6e502ff50e10e25c3bd6d326d8d93c15","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http://dpla-share.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/erie-exhibition/f79666ebec0eb7d01eb3f4e200ba64c2.jpg","size":661758,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1}},"item":{"id":814313,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/814313","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":2239,"page_id":790,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":2239,"caption":"<p><span><span>The “Flight of Five” locks that allowed boats to ascend or descend the sixty-foot Niagara Escarpment became a popular tourist attraction and technological marvel.

As a result of this east-west trade activity, small ports along the Erie Canal grew into viable commercial centers. And some, like Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, became boom towns.

The East began to rely more and more on the West for agricultural products, both for consumption and for export to Europe. As a result of this east-west trade activity, small ports along the Erie Canal grew into viable commercial centers. And some, like Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, became boom towns.

These boats could be anywhere from sixty- to eighty-feet long and fourteen feet wide. The main cabin room was a lounge, kitchen, and dining room by day, and a divided sleeping room (men and women slept separately) at night. The average cost for passenger travel was four cents per mile, including meals and sleeping accommodations.

During the day, passengers could sit outside on the deck or on the roof of the boats, though rooftop riders sometimes needed to look out for low bridges.
