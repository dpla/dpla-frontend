The invention of a gelatin dry plate in 1871, for example, helped photographers create quality images faster and more easily than ever before. It eliminated the need for a tripod and strict posing, allowing for more candid photography.</span></p>\n<p><span>While Eastman Kodak Company was not the only business producing cameras at the end of the nineteenth century, they spearheaded many of the crucial innovations that led to modern photography. Kodak made its consumer debut with the easy-to-use Box Camera in 1888, using the advertising slogan “you press the button – we do the rest.” The camera had a fixed-focus lens and one shutter speed, making it easy to use.</span></p>\n<p><span>This was followed the next year by roll film, which was introduced as an alternative to bulky photographic plates. Photo processing became standardized as well. The Kodak Box Camera was even pre-loaded with a hundred photos-worth of film. Once the exposures were done, users would send the camera back to the manufacturer to be processed and re-loaded. In 1902, the Kodak Developing Machine, which eliminated the need for a formal darkroom, hit the market. This machine allowed photographers to develop their pictures at home, making the camera ready for everyone.</span></p>","id":1049,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2188,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/d5f8cb9777d415bc8ca19bb4031781bb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/d5f8cb9777d415bc8ca19bb4031781bb.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/d5f8cb9777d415bc8ca19bb4031781bb.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/d5f8cb9777d415bc8ca19bb4031781bb.jpg"}}],"id":1049,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Two women with a camera looking out over a desert landscape.

Early film development processes, like tintypes and daguerreotypes, relied on potentially dangerous chemical interactions that were best handled in a controlled environment. For daguerreotype images, popular between 1840 and 1860, the photographer put a sheet of copper, coated with silver and exposed to iodine vapor, into the camera. Once the sheet was exposed to light during the taking of the picture, the photographer used a mercury vapor to bring out the image, and then set it with salt. </span></p>\n<p><span>Because the film process used highly toxic and often dangerous chemicals, photographs were almost exclusively taken by professionals until the twentieth century. Most permanent photography studios were located in major cities, but photographers with out-of-town clients would haul their equipment outside city limits in horse-drawn wagons. This equipment was more than just a camera, which itself was often a large, accordioned box with a lens on one end, plus the glass or copper plates used to take the image. Photographers had to bring along the darkroom and developing chemicals as well.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Early cameras also had a very slow shutter speed, meaning that the shutter remained open exposing the plate to light for a longer period of time. Though early daguerreotype images required an exposure of around twenty minutes, by the early 1840s it had been reduced to about twenty seconds. Even so, photography subjects needed to remain completely still for long periods of time for the image to come out crisp and not blurred by their movement. Sometimes squirming children were put into restraints for the duration of the photo shoot. This need for stillness made posing for a picture a serious business, so the practice of smiling for the camera did not become standard until the 1920s, when technological advancements in camera production allowed for shortened exposure times.</span></span></p>","id":1038,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1377,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/88a13fa36cf1994eb9d29f339e3e7ac5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/88a13fa36cf1994eb9d29f339e3e7ac5.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/88a13fa36cf1994eb9d29f339e3e7ac5.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/88a13fa36cf1994eb9d29f339e3e7ac5.jpeg"}}],"id":1038,"caption":"<p>The camera [cigarette card].

The popularity of digital cameras has led to the sharp decline of film processing and production. Camera stores, film companies, and photo labs are quickly becoming obsolete. Companies such as Polaroid have shuttered their film stock plants, and many manufacturers are no longer making film cameras for the general public. The digital nature of file sharing has dramatically minimized the need for physical prints of photographs, and photo processing businesses are feeling the impact. </span></p>\n<p><span><span>In terms of training, many universities still offer traditional photography programs, but digital photography rules the roost. Darkrooms are nostalgically viewed as “old-school,” rather than as cutting-edge. Because editing software like Photoshop enables amateurs with computer access to manipulate and enhance their own images, professional photographers are also seeing a decline in demand. In 2013 the Chicago <em>Sun-Times</em> axed all twenty-eight of their on-staff photojournalists, saying they would be replaced with iPhone wielding reporters. For better or worse, digital cameras have forever altered the landscape of modern photography.</span></span></p>","id":1078,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1363,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/e03d33ec0be6941eaa0629cc9e3317c1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/e03d33ec0be6941eaa0629cc9e3317c1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/e03d33ec0be6941eaa0629cc9e3317c1.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/e03d33ec0be6941eaa0629cc9e3317c1.jpg"}}],"id":1078,"caption":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Photography lab.

Land, developed the first instant camera as a hobby during World War II. After the war, the growth of the American economy made it possible for new industries to flourish. One of these industries was instant photography. </span></p>\n<p><span>Polaroid photography focused on minimizing the time between taking the photograph and viewing the image. However, the first Polaroid camera, which debuted in 1948, still relied on the photographer to time the development of the film, pull out the print to burst a pod of developing chemicals, and peel away the top film. These first film prints were in sepia-tone, followed by black-and-white prints in 1950. The Polaroid company actually published a magazine advertisement for their black-and-white film before it was available, and their employees worked quickly to meet public demand.</span></p>\n<p><span>As instant camera technology progressed, it became possible for the prints to develop within a minute before the eyes of the user (oftentimes, people would wave Polaroids in the air to encourage faster image development). After the popular black-and-white prints came the peel-apart color prints in 1963, and non-peel-apart color prints followed in 1972. By 1977, the height of its popularity, Polaroid held two-thirds of the instant camera market, despite competition from Kodak.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Around 1979, the sales of instant cameras began to decrease, as video cameras and 35-millimeter cameras became smaller and cheaper. Ultimately, Polaroid’s innovations in instant photography created a public desire which would lead to their own demise at the hands of an even more instant medium</span><span>—</span><span>digital photography. </span></span></p>","id":1060,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1391,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/287cccf4a6ddfc533ee89054ca2521a1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/287cccf4a6ddfc533ee89054ca2521a1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/287cccf4a6ddfc533ee89054ca2521a1.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/287cccf4a6ddfc533ee89054ca2521a1.jpg"}}],"id":1060,"caption":"<p>\"Polaroid SX-70 Land Model 2 with film cartridge protruding from the front.\" Burnett, Colin M.L.. Creative Commons ShareAlike 2.0 license.

Throughout the early to mid-twentieth century, Kodak even engaged children through giveaways and other gimmicks (including debuting a line of Brownie cameras marketed at Boy Scouts), ensuring that youngsters became some of the camera’s most fervent users. Within the first year, Kodak sold over 150,000 Brownies. They would continue to offer new, innovative versions over the next several decades.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>By the time Kodak celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1930, the American love affair with the camera was already in full swing. The popularity of the small, unassuming box that gave ordinary people the power to record their lives through images meant that history was now not only textual, but pictorial as well.</span></span></p>","id":1051,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1372,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/4a7c07288381f1f94065478876835fae.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/4a7c07288381f1f94065478876835fae.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/4a7c07288381f1f94065478876835fae.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/4a7c07288381f1f94065478876835fae.jpg"}}],"id":1051,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Eastman Kodak Co.'s Brownie Camera Ad in <em>Recreation</em> v.13 (6 July-Dec. 1900), p. xxiv.
