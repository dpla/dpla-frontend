Early film development processes, like tintypes and daguerreotypes, relied on potentially dangerous chemical interactions that were best handled in a controlled environment. For daguerreotype images, popular between 1840 and 1860, the photographer put a sheet of copper, coated with silver and exposed to iodine vapor, into the camera.

Though early daguerreotype images required an exposure of around twenty minutes, by the early 1840s it had been reduced to about twenty seconds. Even so, photography subjects needed to remain completely still for long periods of time for the image to come out crisp and not blurred by their movement. Sometimes squirming children were put into restraints for the duration of the photo shoot. This need for stillness made posing for a picture a serious business, so the practice of smiling for the camera did not become standard until the 1920s, when technological advancements in camera production allowed for shortened exposure times.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1038,"caption":"<p>The camera [cigarette card].

Land, developed the first instant camera as a hobby during World War II. After the war, the growth of the American economy made it possible for new industries to flourish. One of these industries was instant photography. </span></p>\n<p><span>Polaroid photography focused on minimizing the time between taking the photograph and viewing the image. However, the first Polaroid camera, which debuted in 1948, still relied on the photographer to time the development of the film, pull out the print to burst a pod of developing chemicals, and peel away the top film. These first film prints were in sepia-tone, followed by black-and-white prints in 1950. The Polaroid company actually published a magazine advertisement for their black-and-white film before it was available, and their employees worked quickly to meet public demand.</span></p>\n<p><span>As instant camera technology progressed, it became possible for the prints to develop within a minute before the eyes of the user (oftentimes, people would wave Polaroids in the air to encourage faster image development). After the popular black-and-white prints came the peel-apart color prints in 1963, and non-peel-apart color prints followed in 1972. By 1977, the height of its popularity, Polaroid held two-thirds of the instant camera market, despite competition from Kodak.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Around 1979, the sales of instant cameras began to decrease, as video cameras and 35-millimeter cameras became smaller and cheaper.

Land, developed the first instant camera as a hobby during World War II. After the war, the growth of the American economy made it possible for new industries to flourish. One of these industries was instant photography. </span></p>\n<p><span>Polaroid photography focused on minimizing the time between taking the photograph and viewing the image. However, the first Polaroid camera, which debuted in 1948, still relied on the photographer to time the development of the film, pull out the print to burst a pod of developing chemicals, and peel away the top film. These first film prints were in sepia-tone, followed by black-and-white prints in 1950. The Polaroid company actually published a magazine advertisement for their black-and-white film before it was available, and their employees worked quickly to meet public demand.</span></p>\n<p><span>As instant camera technology progressed, it became possible for the prints to develop within a minute before the eyes of the user (oftentimes, people would wave Polaroids in the air to encourage faster image development). After the popular black-and-white prints came the peel-apart color prints in 1963, and non-peel-apart color prints followed in 1972.

People could take pictures on impulse and then moments later have a developed photo. Unlike other types of film, Polaroid prints did not produce a negative and (before the development of digital scanners) could not be reproduced. Rather, they were solely images “of the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Polaroid advertisements in the mid twentieth-century wowed buyers with the promise that they could “take and show party pictures while the fun is going on.” They also emphasized the use of their cameras in social settings, with advertisements saying, “You’re the life of the party with a Polaroid Land Camera.” In 1976, Editor-in-Chief of the </span><span>British Journal of Photography</span><span>, Geoffrey Crawley, observed that taking instant photos had morphed picture taking into a communal activity that could be enjoyed amongst groups of friends. Writer Peggy Sealfon also noted that instant cameras could be used as icebreakers, and “[w]ould motivate people to do unexpected things, just to see the immediate record of their behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Polaroid’s immediately-viewable images were the world’s introduction to the concept of instant images and a precursor to digital photography.
