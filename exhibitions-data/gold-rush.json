The Oregon question was resolved in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was legally recognized as a possession of the United States, solidifying the country’s reach into the Pacific Northwest. The Mexican-American War had ended in 1848 as well, with Mexico ceding most of California as well as Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado to the United States.

Despite the hopes of early European colonizers, gold remained elusive in the eastern settlements of the thirteen colonies and tobacco prevailed as the sustaining economic export. After gaining its independence from England, the United States struggled to develop a national sense of identity that would unite its economically diverse colonies. With independence, it became legal to allow settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, previously the general border of European settlement. As the newly formed America consolidated its hold on more and more “available” land, purchasing the Louisiana Territory from France and establishing a solid border with British-held Canada in the Oregon Territory and northern Maine, westward expansion became an integral part of what it meant to be American. The idea of Manifest Destiny began to take hold. American citizens began to believe and to preach that it was their God-given right and duty to take over the entire continent, to take control of the land from the Native Americans, who white Americans believed did not understand or practice correct land stewardship and therefore did not deserve to retain their ancestral homes. It was during this period of nationalistic expansion that gold was first discovered in 1848 at Sutter’s Mill in present-day California.</span></p>\n<p><span>This exhibition explores the Gold Rush—a group of related gold rushes to Western territories in the second half of the nineteenth century—and its impact on American history and culture.

A special term emerged—those who rushed to California upon receiving news of gold discovery were called “forty-niners.” South Americans sailed up the west coast of the continent or around Cape Horn, braving one of the most hazardous stretches of ocean on earth. Emigrants from China and the Philippines made their way across the Pacific, and the sailors who worked the ships were entranced by word of gold, abandoning their ships in San Francisco’s harbor for the elusive promise of fortune. Europeans journeyed by train and ship and wagon across the vast expanse of prairie in the center of the continent. They joined the American migrants from the east coast as they made their way along the recently established Oregon Trail and detoured southwest somewhere in what would become Wyoming, crossing deserts and mountains and risking life and limb in pursuit of the promised gold.

Violence was disturbingly common; boomtowns had incredibly high rates of homicide during their relatively short existences. Conveniences were incredibly expensive, as retailers used lack of supply, difficulty of access, and high demand to charge exorbitant prices for basic foodstuffs or clothing. At smaller mining claims, life was even rougher—often the miner and his family (if they were with him) lived in quickly constructed shacks in the wilderness miles from neighbors and were forced to fend for themselves.

By 1908 Goldfield was Nevada's largest city, with over 25,000 inhabitants. Along with the influx of miners and businessmen, came the labor unions. The Western Federation of Miners, the Industrial Workers of the World and the American Federation of Labor all vied for power in the region. During the early years, the unions were able to control wages and working hours. But in November, 1906, the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company was incorporated by owners George Wingfield and United States Senator George Nixon, signaling the beginning of monopoly control in Goldfield, and the start of an adversarial relationship between mine owners and the unions.\" -- unknown author.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Pierce, C.C.

Asian and South American immigrants, as well as those Spanish-speaking Californios who had lived in the area since before California belonged to the United States, were relegated to the lowest classes of society. White men often superseded claims they made upon gold deposits, for even if the immigrant had discovered the gold first the white man had the weight of the law behind him. Violence was endemic to the mining communities, and more often than not was directed at racial minorities by white men, and assault was seen as completely within the legal rights of the white assailants. Early on, taxes were enacted that specifically targeted immigrants, and white miners often took advantage of new residents who spoke little English to con them out of more money than they already owed. Although mining towns allowed for more interaction between ethnic and racial groups than was usually possible in America’s more “civilized” areas, the mores and thinking of the times continued to allow white miners and those who could pass as white to maintain higher social standing than immigrants of color, and these traditions were generally enforced by an unchallenged, racist legal system.</span></span></p>","id":646,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":818,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/6fc420f9cae1d41b4cc2777cc6c328e0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/6fc420f9cae1d41b4cc2777cc6c328e0.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/6fc420f9cae1d41b4cc2777cc6c328e0.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/6fc420f9cae1d41b4cc2777cc6c328e0.jpeg"}}],"id":646,"caption":"<p>Courtesy the <span>Idaho State Historical Society, via the Mountain West Digital Library.</span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Chinese miners in Idaho","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"c32c223601d3d2d707d95d6403d1d042","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":811029}}]},{"text":null,"id":647,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":803,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/73aabd2609f4768d62aaaa5c4f2f7b1f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/73aabd2609f4768d62aaaa5c4f2f7b1f.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/73aabd2609f4768d62aaaa5c4f2f7b1f.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/73aabd2609f4768d62aaaa5c4f2f7b1f.jpg"}}],"id":647,"caption":"<p>Courtesy the <span>Pikes Peak Library District.</span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Reproduction available for purchase.","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"The wheel-barrow emigrant","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"One of six wood engravings in two-page spread in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, April 30, 1859, titled 'Going to Pike's Peak, the New Gold Region - From Sketches by our own Correspondent.'

Native men were often slaughtered if they were not put to work, and women and children were kidnapped and used as cheap labor or for sexual gratification. The natural resources that various tribes had relied on for centuries were decimated in months, leading to death by starvation for thousands who had managed to escape murder or slavery. Massacres of entire villages were commonplace throughout the American West and were reported in newspapers as sport, often with morbid headlines “Good Haul of Diggers.” Tribes throughout the West were annihilated in incredibly short stretches of time, and for those who managed to survive the bloodbath, the future was bleak.

Although this number gradually balanced out through the 1850s, and subsequent gold rushes such as the Klondike Rush in Alaska were never quite as segregated, women were seen as “other” in the West well into the 20th century. While many women capitalized on new, looser social mores to make their own destiny by working in the mines or operating businesses they could never have owned alone back east, most of the women who eventually made their way west did so as helpmeets to the men and symbols of a return to social order. A woman in the West could earn her husband a lot of money with her homemaking skills like laundry or baking, and men saw marriage as not only a necessary emotional or physical contract but also a good economic investment. As large numbers of women arrived in boomtowns, they formed groups very similar to those that existed back East, such as temperance societies and church social groups, and worked to tone down the social behaviors of rowdy miners. Prostitutes, who for a time were the most numerous female group in the West, were the one exception to this trend. By 1850, San Francisco alone had over 2,000 prostitutes, some of whom were elite and mixed with the city’s burgeoning high society, but most of whom were simply good-time girls, providing sexual favors to lonely and often violent miners in small tents or shacks for meager earnings. While the West was symbolic of opportunity and frontiers for many who travelled there, including thousands of white women, it was also bound by the morals of its time. Women were accorded many new freedoms as long as they agreed to abide by the existing social contract.</span></p>\n<p> </p>","id":642,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":801,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/2ccf4d98c15dc575cee7d5cd6467bf24.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/2ccf4d98c15dc575cee7d5cd6467bf24.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/2ccf4d98c15dc575cee7d5cd6467bf24.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/2ccf4d98c15dc575cee7d5cd6467bf24.jpg"}}],"id":642,"caption":"<p>Courtesy the <span>Pikes Peak Library District.</span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"(c) Pikes Peak Library District.
