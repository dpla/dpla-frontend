The prevalent belief at the time was that the disease came from bacteria known as Pfeiffer's bacillus (Bacillus influenza). Others believed the cause was an unbalanced diet or the anxiety of life in wartime. Research since then has led scientists to theorize that the influenza originated as a swine or avian flu, now classified as the Influenza A, H1N1 virus—a disease that remains active today.</span></p>\n<p>There had been prior influenza outbreaks in the US, the most recent pandemic occurring in 1889-1890. However, in previous outbreaks, it was typically the young, the old, and those with compromised immune systems that were the most susceptible. This time, primarily healthy people between the ages of 18 and 49 were afflicted. Symptoms ranged from typical flu symptoms, like aches and pains, fever, dizziness, headache, congestion, and vomiting, to more extreme ones, like hemorrhaging of the eyes and/or ears. Lungs might even fill with fluid, which slowly suffocated the victim. Some victims died within a few days of contracting influenza, whereas others died of secondary complications such as pneumonia.</p>","id":886,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1202,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/1cada94eef5e16742afaf2ec01189071.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/1cada94eef5e16742afaf2ec01189071.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/1cada94eef5e16742afaf2ec01189071.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/1cada94eef5e16742afaf2ec01189071.jpg"}}],"id":886,"caption":"<p><span><span>A photograph of Haemophilus influenzae taken through a microscope, 2006.

In total, 70 million men were at war on multiple fronts across Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. The tide was finally turning for the Allies after a crushing offensive by German forces mere weeks earlier. Then, a fierce enemy intervened—an outbreak of influenza that would decimate entire regiments and towns, kill civilians and soldiers alike by the millions, and rapidly become a global pandemic. This disease weakened forces on both sides, changing not only the course of the war but also the economies and population stability of every affected nation. In the long term, this particular outbreak would inspire research on an unprecedented scale and lead to advances in science and medicine, forever altering our understanding of epidemiology. From the spring of 1918 to early 1919, no aspect of life remained untouched by the pandemic for Americans at home and on the front.

In the US, the first wave appeared in the spring of 1918, the second in the fall of 1918, and the third in the early winter of 1919.
