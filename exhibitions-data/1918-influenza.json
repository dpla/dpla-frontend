Men and women of the medical community were at the forefront of this growing crisis. The war in Europe meant an increase in the number of men in the military ranks, but also the number of doctors enlisted to care for them. By 1918, it was estimated that 30 percent of all American physicians were in military service. While this number was crucial to sustaining the military, it left a wide gap in civilian medical coverage.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>This gap would be felt most profoundly in the fall of 1918, during the second, deadlier wave of the influenza outbreak.  Hospitals and staff were pushed to their limits with homefront care, often leaving only medical students and volunteers to help with the sick.  To assist where the need was greatest, the American Red Cross recruited a total of 15,000 nurses (ranging from students to women who took the \"Red Cross Home Hygiene Course\") to serve both civilians and the military. Of these, at least 223 nurses and five dietitians died while providing care to flu victims.</span></span></p>",

Men and women of the medical community were at the forefront of this growing crisis. The war in Europe meant an increase in the number of men in the military ranks, but also the number of doctors enlisted to care for them. By 1918, it was estimated that 30 percent of all American physicians were in military service. While this number was crucial to sustaining the military, it left a wide gap in civilian medical coverage.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>This gap would be felt most profoundly in the fall of 1918, during the second, deadlier wave of the influenza outbreak.  Hospitals and staff were pushed to their limits with homefront care, often leaving only medical students and volunteers to help with the sick.  To assist where the need was greatest, the American Red Cross recruited a total of 15,000 nurses (ranging from students to women who took the \"Red Cross Home Hygiene Course\") to serve both civilians and the military. Of these, at least 223 nurses and five dietitians died while providing care to flu victims.</span></span></p>",

The immediate flu crisis had passed but Americans would deal with its consequences long after. Estimates vary, but the most widely accepted world death tolls reach 25 to 50 million worldwide, with more than 1.5 million of these on American soil, in addition to military losses abroad.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Other pandemics and health crises affected early twentieth-century Americans and their predecessors, but this one was different because of its rapid spread, faster progression, and disproportionate effect on the young and healthy. This, combined with the loss of so many young men at the front to disease and injury, led to a population lull in the US that would take several years to rebound to original numbers. The disease itself was so virulent that it continued to mutate and resist eradication. In fact, all Influenza-A outbreaks since that time have been descendants of the 1918 strain.</span></span></p>",

The immediate flu crisis had passed but Americans would deal with its consequences long after. Estimates vary, but the most widely accepted world death tolls reach 25 to 50 million worldwide, with more than 1.5 million of these on American soil, in addition to military losses abroad.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Other pandemics and health crises affected early twentieth-century Americans and their predecessors, but this one was different because of its rapid spread, faster progression, and disproportionate effect on the young and healthy. This, combined with the loss of so many young men at the front to disease and injury, led to a population lull in the US that would take several years to rebound to original numbers. The disease itself was so virulent that it continued to mutate and resist eradication. In fact, all Influenza-A outbreaks since that time have been descendants of the 1918 strain.</span></span></p>",

          "text": "<p>The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic was unique because it came in three waves, whereas previous outbreaks were characterized by a single wave with limited geographic dispersion. This pandemic spread quickly and globally, claiming an estimated 50 million lives, among them some 500,000 Americans. In the US, the first wave appeared in the spring of 1918, the second in the fall of 1918, and the third in the early winter of 1919. Of the three waves, the second was most fatal, which led to a theory that survivors of the second wave had developed protective immunity.</p>\n<p>Like the mystery surrounding its biological origins, there are many theories about where the influenza started and how it spread. The dominant theory at the time claimed it began in Spain in April 1918, as evidenced by the large number of afflicted people documented there early on. This led to the misnomer \"Spanish Flu.\" Another theory hypothesized that the flu originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, and spread via soldiers wherever they were deployed. Yet another theory suggested that soldiers brought it home from China where it quickly spread to US civilians. Despite numerous speculations, scientists have yet to determine the precise geographic origin of the disease.</p>\n<p> </p>",

          "text": "<p>The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic was unique because it came in three waves, whereas previous outbreaks were characterized by a single wave with limited geographic dispersion. This pandemic spread quickly and globally, claiming an estimated 50 million lives, among them some 500,000 Americans. In the US, the first wave appeared in the spring of 1918, the second in the fall of 1918, and the third in the early winter of 1919. Of the three waves, the second was most fatal, which led to a theory that survivors of the second wave had developed protective immunity.</p>\n<p>Like the mystery surrounding its biological origins, there are many theories about where the influenza started and how it spread. The dominant theory at the time claimed it began in Spain in April 1918, as evidenced by the large number of afflicted people documented there early on. This led to the misnomer \"Spanish Flu.\" Another theory hypothesized that the flu originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, and spread via soldiers wherever they were deployed. Yet another theory suggested that soldiers brought it home from China where it quickly spread to US civilians. Despite numerous speculations, scientists have yet to determine the precise geographic origin of the disease.</p>\n<p> </p>",
