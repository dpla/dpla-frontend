Some 60,000 Americans died in battle, while over 200,000 were wounded. An additional 60,000 died of disease, many from the influenza pandemic that killed over twenty million people across the globe in 1918 and 1919.</p>\n<p>The homecoming of Americans who had gone to the frontlines was met with much fanfare and many a parade.
