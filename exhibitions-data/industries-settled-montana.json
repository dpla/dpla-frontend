Montana's climate was in a wet cycle from 1909 to 1917, which encouraged homesteaders to flock to Montana for the free land and set to work farming and developing farming methods. Money poured into the state to encourage the development of irrigation projects. Other farmers worked to develop dryland farming techniques. James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern Railroad, sponsored dryland farming conferences and exhibitions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hardy Webster Campbell promoted subsurface compacting, a method of plowing that firmly packed the loose soil at the bottom of a furrow so it would hold water where the roots developed. Then the top two to three inches were tilled into a loose, dry layer. Researchers at Montana Agricultural College, now Montana State University, advocated against use of this method, but many farmers put it into practice. Homesteaders learned over time how detrimental their farming methods were to the land because their nutrient-rich topsoil blew away in Montana's heavy winds.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>When the United States entered World War I in 1917, farmers' markets expanded once again. The government pushed farmers to increase production to meet the demands of a nation at war with slogans such as \"Food will win the war.\" Farmers borrowed money to buy land and equipment. When the war ended, many farmers were deep in debt. The wet cycle of Montana's climate ended bringing fires, drought, and locusts. Between 1921 and 1925 at least half of the farmers in Montana lost their farms. Farmers who were successful in keeping and enlarging their holdings improved farming practices through the use of better methods and improved equipment.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1121,"caption":"<p>“Threshing grain in the Great Judith Basin near Hobson, Montana,\" 1910.

Montana's climate was in a wet cycle from 1909 to 1917, which encouraged homesteaders to flock to Montana for the free land and set to work farming and developing farming methods. Money poured into the state to encourage the development of irrigation projects. Other farmers worked to develop dryland farming techniques. James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern Railroad, sponsored dryland farming conferences and exhibitions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hardy Webster Campbell promoted subsurface compacting, a method of plowing that firmly packed the loose soil at the bottom of a furrow so it would hold water where the roots developed. Then the top two to three inches were tilled into a loose, dry layer. Researchers at Montana Agricultural College, now Montana State University, advocated against use of this method, but many farmers put it into practice. Homesteaders learned over time how detrimental their farming methods were to the land because their nutrient-rich topsoil blew away in Montana's heavy winds.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>When the United States entered World War I in 1917, farmers' markets expanded once again. The government pushed farmers to increase production to meet the demands of a nation at war with slogans such as \"Food will win the war.\" Farmers borrowed money to buy land and equipment. When the war ended, many farmers were deep in debt. The wet cycle of Montana's climate ended bringing fires, drought, and locusts. Between 1921 and 1925 at least half of the farmers in Montana lost their farms. Farmers who were successful in keeping and enlarging their holdings improved farming practices through the use of better methods and improved equipment.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1121,"caption":"<p>“Threshing grain in the Great Judith Basin near Hobson, Montana,\" 1910.

The first miners were high-risk fortune hunters who rushed into profitable areas and quickly abandoned unprofitable sites. These miners had small placer operations—mining methods that used water—which required simple equipment such as a gold pan, pick, shovel, and a water source. Other placer miners added items such as a rocker, which two people operate to sift the minerals from the rock. Both methods of placer mining required manual labor and water for washing the gravel and sand away from the heavier gold. Small miners often worked long, hard days for a couple dollars worth of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana had three major strikes that produced large amounts of gold. In July 1862, a prospector named John White and his partner discovered gold at Grasshopper Creek and founded the town of Bannack nearby. Grasshopper Creek produced five million dollars in gold dust in its first year. In May 1863, two prospectors left Bannack to search for gold, bringing them into conflict with the Crow Indians who took the miners' equipment and sent them packing. On their way back, the men camped along Alder Creek and decided to pan a little. Their panning produced gold and within a few months hordes had flocked to the area around Virginia City. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>On July 14, 1864, a group known as the Four Georgians began working Last Chance Gulch. These men found the gold plentiful and easy to remove. Over the next four years, Last Chance Gulch produced nineteen million dollars in gold. Soon the city of Helena grew up around the gulch.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1107,"caption":"<p>\"The Old Mining Town of Kendall, Montana,\" ca. 1900.

The first miners were high-risk fortune hunters who rushed into profitable areas and quickly abandoned unprofitable sites. These miners had small placer operations—mining methods that used water—which required simple equipment such as a gold pan, pick, shovel, and a water source. Other placer miners added items such as a rocker, which two people operate to sift the minerals from the rock. Both methods of placer mining required manual labor and water for washing the gravel and sand away from the heavier gold. Small miners often worked long, hard days for a couple dollars worth of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana had three major strikes that produced large amounts of gold. In July 1862, a prospector named John White and his partner discovered gold at Grasshopper Creek and founded the town of Bannack nearby. Grasshopper Creek produced five million dollars in gold dust in its first year. In May 1863, two prospectors left Bannack to search for gold, bringing them into conflict with the Crow Indians who took the miners' equipment and sent them packing. On their way back, the men camped along Alder Creek and decided to pan a little. Their panning produced gold and within a few months hordes had flocked to the area around Virginia City. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>On July 14, 1864, a group known as the Four Georgians began working Last Chance Gulch. These men found the gold plentiful and easy to remove. Over the next four years, Last Chance Gulch produced nineteen million dollars in gold. Soon the city of Helena grew up around the gulch.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1107,"caption":"<p>\"The Old Mining Town of Kendall, Montana,\" ca. 1900.

In the 1850s, fur traders like Richard Grant began buying exhausted cattle from wagon trains traveling the Oregon Trail. These cattle were moved to range ground and \"fattened up\" before being herded back to the Oregon trail to be traded or sold.</span></p>\n<p><span>When gold was discovered in the late nineteenth century, the cattle industry boomed. As more and more gold miners and prospectors poured into Montana, more and more food was needed to feed them. These new hunters quickly depleted Montana's wild game populations and then turned to ranchers for their meat supply.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>With a new market for their cattle, ranchers liked Montana for its abundant open land for grazing as well as its high quality grass. The hardy Montana grasses dried standing up and strong winter winds blew snow away so the grass did not flatten, making it edible all winter. As hunters seeking furs decimated the bison herds, open-range ranching grew. The wide tracts of land claimed by the US Government in treaties and by force from Indian tribes made prime grazing country that was newly available to use.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1116,"caption":"<p>\"Evelyn Cameron Kneading Bread,\" ca. 1906. <span>Evelyn Cameron and her husband ranched in Eastern Montana and documented their experience in photos and a detailed journal. </span>Courtesy of the Montana Historical Society Research Center via Big Sky Country Digital Network.</p>","item":{"id":811617,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811617"}},{"id":1116,"caption":"<p>\"Evelyn Cameron Kneading Bread,\" ca. 1906. <span>Evelyn Cameron and her husband ranched in Eastern Montana and documented their experience in photos and a detailed journal. </span>Courtesy of the Montana Historical Society Research Center via Big Sky Country Digital Network.</p>","item":{"id":811617,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811617"},"files":[{"id":1442,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/1442","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/bd64738f0a4dc94cd621cc7f0a95316e.png","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/bd64738f0a4dc94cd621cc7f0a95316e.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/bd64738f0a4dc94cd621cc7f0a95316e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/bd64738f0a4dc94cd621cc7f0a95316e.jpg"},"added":"2015-07-25T08:08:36+00:00","modified":"2017-08-22T09:00:15+00:00","filename":"bd64738f0a4dc94cd621cc7f0a95316e.png","authentication":"5d7a3bccb5df22d4c31017e5b3efaf9b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/png","order":null,"original_filename":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/144273204/Montana/be1a3cbe5d46d90afd6e7caf2f42b9c4.png","size":870287,"stored":true,"type_os":"PNG image data, 841 x 1200, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/png","video":{"dataformat":"png","lossless":false,"resolution_x":841,"resolution_y":1200,"bits_per_sample":32,"compression_ratio":0.21558833729687},"comments":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=\"adobe:ns:meta/\" x:xmptk=\"XMP Core 5.4.0\">\n   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\">\n      <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"\"\n            xmlns:exif=\"http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/\"\n            xmlns:tiff=\"http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/\">\n         <exif:PixelYDimension>841</exif:PixelYDimension>\n         <exif:PixelXDimension>1200</exif:PixelXDimension>\n         <tiff:Orientation>1</tiff:Orientation>\n      </rdf:Description>\n   </rdf:RDF>\n</x:xmpmeta>"]},"comments_html":{"XML:com.adobe.xmp":["&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x=&quot;adobe:ns:meta/&quot; x:xmptk=&quot;XMP Core 5.4.0&quot;&gt;&#10;   &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;&quot;&#10;            xmlns:exif=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/&quot;&#10;            xmlns:tiff=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/&quot;&gt;&#10;         &lt;exif:PixelYDimension&gt;841&lt;/exif:PixelYDimension&gt;&#10;         &lt;exif:PixelXDimension&gt;1200&lt;/exif:PixelXDimension&gt;&#10;         &lt;tiff:Orientation&gt;1&lt;/tiff:Orientation&gt;&#10;      &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;&#10;   &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;&#10;&lt;/x:xmpmeta&gt;"]}},"item":{"id":811617,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/811617","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":1117,"page_id":483,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":3,"attachments":[{"id":1117,"caption":"<p>\"A.E.

Mining brought in secondary industries like smelters, cement plants, construction, utilities, heavy equipment, and transportation. Unfortunately, these industries damaged the environment. Many Anaconda Mining Company ventures, including the smelters in Black Eagle and Anaconda, along with the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area, were named Superfund (or abandoned hazardous waste) cleanup sites in the early 1980s by the Environmental Protection Agency. Libby was named a Superfund site because of asbestos mining, while East Helena earned the same designation because of the smelting conducted there by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). Environmental abuses, such as the Berkeley Pit, had a major impact on Montana's 1972 Constitution, which features very strong legal language granting its citizens the right to a clean and healthful environment.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana's mining sector transformed its cultural and political history. The Copper Kings’ money influenced state politics heavily and even the location of the capital city.

Mining brought in secondary industries like smelters, cement plants, construction, utilities, heavy equipment, and transportation. Unfortunately, these industries damaged the environment. Many Anaconda Mining Company ventures, including the smelters in Black Eagle and Anaconda, along with the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area, were named Superfund (or abandoned hazardous waste) cleanup sites in the early 1980s by the Environmental Protection Agency. Libby was named a Superfund site because of asbestos mining, while East Helena earned the same designation because of the smelting conducted there by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). Environmental abuses, such as the Berkeley Pit, had a major impact on Montana's 1972 Constitution, which features very strong legal language granting its citizens the right to a clean and healthful environment.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana's mining sector transformed its cultural and political history. The Copper Kings’ money influenced state politics heavily and even the location of the capital city. Women, who were allowed to file mining claims and hold their own property, helped Montana elect the first woman to Congress, Jeannette Rankin, in 1916. Jobs drew people to Montana who built and diversified its communities.</span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1148,"caption":"<p>The town of Anaconda was built by Marcus Daly for the purpose of smelting ore from his Anaconda Copper Mine.
