These included the Kootenai, Salish, Pend d’Oreille, Shoshone, Crow, Piegan Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Cree and Chippewa, Sioux, and Northern Cheyenne.</span></p>\n<p><span>The area's first white settlers were fur traders from Canada, England, and the United States who explored the region looking for beaver for fur companies like the Hudson Bay Company and the American Fur Company. These fur traders arrived in the first half of the nineteenth century following the trail used by Lewis and Clark.</span></p>\n<p><span>Fur traders venturing into native lands faced risks that were easier to negotiate if the trapper took a native wife. Native women played a significant role in teaching their non-Indian husbands how to navigate the territory, where to find food, how to survive the winters, how to communicate with Indians, and how to peacefully negotiate places to trap. The offspring of these interracial marriages created a new group called the Metis.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Fur companies became bitter rivals and competition often turned violent. The non-Indians pressured Indians to take sides. This led to further violence and eventually revenge killings. The fur trade brought goods to the Indians that they quickly became dependent on, adding to pressures they faced to maintain the relationships with the fur traders. Realizing the power of cheap whiskey, fur traders often used this item to exercise control over the Indians. Along with the important trade items came disease. Smallpox and other deadly diseases decimated the Indian populations.</span></span></p>",

Montana's climate was in a wet cycle from 1909 to 1917, which encouraged homesteaders to flock to Montana for the free land and set to work farming and developing farming methods. Money poured into the state to encourage the development of irrigation projects. Other farmers worked to develop dryland farming techniques. James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern Railroad, sponsored dryland farming conferences and exhibitions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hardy Webster Campbell promoted subsurface compacting, a method of plowing that firmly packed the loose soil at the bottom of a furrow so it would hold water where the roots developed. Then the top two to three inches were tilled into a loose, dry layer. Researchers at Montana Agricultural College, now Montana State University, advocated against use of this method, but many farmers put it into practice. Homesteaders learned over time how detrimental their farming methods were to the land because their nutrient-rich topsoil blew away in Montana's heavy winds.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>When the United States entered World War I in 1917, farmers' markets expanded once again. The government pushed farmers to increase production to meet the demands of a nation at war with slogans such as \"Food will win the war.\" Farmers borrowed money to buy land and equipment. When the war ended, many farmers were deep in debt. The wet cycle of Montana's climate ended bringing fires, drought, and locusts. Between 1921 and 1925 at least half of the farmers in Montana lost their farms. Farmers who were successful in keeping and enlarging their holdings improved farming practices through the use of better methods and improved equipment.</span></span></p>",

Most of this land had not been previously explored or documented. President Thomas Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead an ambitious military expedition, seeking a northwestern passage to the Pacific Ocean and to document their journey in this unknown territory. Starting in what is now Missouri, the expedition followed the Missouri River and passed through present-day Montana on its way to the Pacific. The explorers commented on the beauty of the landscape and the abundance of animals, and their descriptions attracted fur traders and others ready to take advantage of the region's abundant natural resources. The discovery of gold in 1862 brought in the first rush of people and subsequent mining forever changed the region. The mining industry demanded support in the form of towns, railroads, logging, ranching, and farming. These industries shaped Montana and the people who settled there.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>This exhibition explores the industries that brought settlers to Montana from the early days to the 1920s. Each industry had its own “boom and bust” cycle that impacted the residents and the future of the state.</span></span></p>",

Due to language barriers and different styles of governing, confusion reigned. The treaties supposedly gave non-Indians permission to build roads and railroads through the reservations in exchange for annuities. Despite protections promised by the treaties, settlers were encouraged to trespass on Indian lands to log, farm, ranch, and mine. The government sometimes neglected to pay the agreed-upon annuities, and when they did, they paid with low-quality or broken equipment and spoiled food.</span></p>\n<p><span>The US government wanted to profit from Montana’s natural assets and gave executive orders to reduce the size of reservations and used military force to ensure compliance. The Indians did not believe in land ownership, and this caused problems as assimilation efforts pushed the Indians to settle in one place to farm or ranch. In order to free up more land for white development, Congress passed the Dawes Act in 1887, which divided tribal lands into allotments of 160 acres for each head of household and 80 acres for each single man. Any land left after these allotments were established was considered surplus and sold to white settlers. In Montana, 400,000 acres were surplused.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Many people still felt the tribes were not assimilating fast enough and felt Indian children needed to be raised like white children to speed the process along. Indian children were forcibly taken from their parents and sent to military-like boarding schools to be educated and taught to work.</span></span></p>",

Lumber was required for the new industry and the influx of people who rushed to the territory seeking their fortunes. Miners needed everything from sluice boxes, to firewood, to cabins, to stores. Wagons, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure used in mining required wood. One of the first sawmills was established near Virginia City in 1862. Lack of access to proper tools forced many loggers to improvise tools for logging. Dozens of small steam or water-powered lumber mills were soon operating in communities throughout the region.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Logging originally required lots of manual labor. Sawyers would first cut a notch in one side of a tree to determine the direction of its fall. Then the fellers, who used a two-man crosscut saw, would fell the tree. Logs were taken by horse drawn wagons to the nearest river for transport when the water ran high. Locations near water were soon stripped of trees forcing loggers to travel farther to timber sources. Some companies built railroad tracks into heavily timbered areas. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>After 1913, loggers began using high powered engines with a 100-ton winch, called steam donkeys, to haul logs to a road or railroad. The 1920s brought gasoline-powered tractors, trucks, and other vehicles. This industrialization made logging easier but created new problems for the natural environment, such as erosion and damage to animal habitats.</span></span></p>",

The first miners were high-risk fortune hunters who rushed into profitable areas and quickly abandoned unprofitable sites. These miners had small placer operations—mining methods that used water—which required simple equipment such as a gold pan, pick, shovel, and a water source. Other placer miners added items such as a rocker, which two people operate to sift the minerals from the rock. Both methods of placer mining required manual labor and water for washing the gravel and sand away from the heavier gold. Small miners often worked long, hard days for a couple dollars worth of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana had three major strikes that produced large amounts of gold. In July 1862, a prospector named John White and his partner discovered gold at Grasshopper Creek and founded the town of Bannack nearby. Grasshopper Creek produced five million dollars in gold dust in its first year. In May 1863, two prospectors left Bannack to search for gold, bringing them into conflict with the Crow Indians who took the miners' equipment and sent them packing. On their way back, the men camped along Alder Creek and decided to pan a little. Their panning produced gold and within a few months hordes had flocked to the area around Virginia City. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>On July 14, 1864, a group known as the Four Georgians began working Last Chance Gulch. These men found the gold plentiful and easy to remove. Over the next four years, Last Chance Gulch produced nineteen million dollars in gold. Soon the city of Helena grew up around the gulch.</span></span></p>",

In the 1850s, fur traders like Richard Grant began buying exhausted cattle from wagon trains traveling the Oregon Trail. These cattle were moved to range ground and \"fattened up\" before being herded back to the Oregon trail to be traded or sold.</span></p>\n<p><span>When gold was discovered in the late nineteenth century, the cattle industry boomed. As more and more gold miners and prospectors poured into Montana, more and more food was needed to feed them. These new hunters quickly depleted Montana's wild game populations and then turned to ranchers for their meat supply.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>With a new market for their cattle, ranchers liked Montana for its abundant open land for grazing as well as its high quality grass. The hardy Montana grasses dried standing up and strong winter winds blew snow away so the grass did not flatten, making it edible all winter. As hunters seeking furs decimated the bison herds, open-range ranching grew. The wide tracts of land claimed by the US Government in treaties and by force from Indian tribes made prime grazing country that was newly available to use.</span></span></p>",

This act offered 160 acres of public land to US citizens on the condition that they live on, cultivate, and improve it. They could then \"prove up\" and obtain a deed after five years. The first homestead claim was made near present-day Helena in 1868.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the original Homestead Act did not attract large numbers of settlers to Montana due to the small size of land relative to the growing conditions and type of dry farming required. Congress passed several supplementary laws including the 1877 Desert Land Act, which allowed homesteaders to claim 640 acres of land if they irrigated within three years. These claims appealed to cattle companies who acquired land earned through hired individual claimants. By 1882, 370 desert claim filings were made in the Montana Territory covering 122,000 acres.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>But it was the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 that brought the greatest influx of homesteaders to Montana. Most were individual farmers. This new act doubled the amount of land available for claim to 320 acres and later shortened the \"prove up\" time to three years. Railroads launched massive advertising campaigns to bring homesteaders to Montana. More than 80,000 homesteaders arrived between 1909 and the early 1920s. At its peak in 1918, 14,178 homestead claims were filed on 3.2 million acres. When it was over, an estimated 300,000 people had filed for homesteads in Montana with at least eighteen percent of these claims filed by unmarried women.</span></span></p>",

These sites were visited by hired fur traders, local Indian traders, early missionaries arriving to convert and assimilate American Indians, and others looking to acquire supplies and exchange news. One of the earliest examples was Fort Benton, built by the Chouteau brothers—Western Agents for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company—and positioned at a port on the Missouri River to facilitate trade by riverboat.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>After the American Civil War, the US Army purchased old forts and constructed new ones to protect and support growing numbers of white settlers moving into the Montana Territory. These forts were stops along trails, like the Bozeman Trail, used for early Gold Rush travel. As the US Army focused its attention increasingly on the West and its containment of American Indian tribes on reservations, these forts provided supplies and housing for divisions of soldiers fighting in the Indian Wars, including divisions made up of African Americans known as Buffalo Soldiers. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Particularly after the dramatic US Army defeat at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, and despite the fact that many Indians were already living on reservations, the US Army created new outposts like Fort Custer, Fort Keogh, and Fort Ellis to protect settlers from real and imagined Indian threats. These forts also provided jumping-off points for military exploration into surrounding unsettled areas like present-day Yellowstone National Park. Many of the military forts were decommissioned around the 1880s with the arrival of the railroad, while others were absorbed into Indian reservations.</span></span></p>",

Railroads would make remote places accessible to new residents, while shipping the area’s plentiful natural resources to markets across the country.</span></p>\n<p><span>By 1869, the Union Pacific Railroad’s route through Corinne, Utah, would bring the Transcontinental Railroad within 500 miles of Montana. The Union Pacific started laying track for the Utah and Northern Railway that would connect its system with Butte’s mines. After eight years of arduous construction, the first train arrived in Butte, Montana, in 1881. This symbolic starting point still left most of Montana without railroad access.</span></p>\n<p><span>As the planning began on massive railroad lines across the southern and northern parts of the territory, railroad companies realized that they would need control of more Indian lands. They pressured the government to negotiate reductions of Indian reservation land through new agreements. Through these corrupt dealings, in 1882, the Crow would lose 1.5 million acres to the Northern Pacific Railroad, while in 1887, northern tribes would sell 17 million acres of land—including the sacred Sweetgrass Hills region—to the Great Northern Railway for 1.5 millions dollars that was never paid in full.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The Northern Pacific and the Great Northern Railway, along with the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad, which arrived in 1907, employed Asian immigrants in low-paying, back-breaking jobs laying their track and African Americans who worked as porters and waiters on the trains. Their rail lines soon crisscrossed Montana, connecting towns, facilitating industrial boom years, and marking the transition to statehood.</span></span></p>",

The gold fields attracted all kinds of people including those who would profit from the hard work of others by becoming criminals. Miners courts were developed to handle many disputes, but were hardly equipped to deal with the amount of violence present in the mining camps. One of the most famous criminals in Montana was Henry Plummer, who was, ironically, sheriff of the Bannack District. He and his gang were suspected of robbing gold shipments and murdering miners for their gold. Plummer met his end swinging from a rope hung by the local vigilance committee.</span></p>\n<p><span>Vigilance committees were formed by concerned citizens who wanted some form of protection and acted as a police force for an area hundreds of miles away from any official law enforcement. Vigilante justice was swift and not always reliable as it often took little evidence for a conviction and hanging to occur.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>In 1863, President Lincoln sent Sidney Edgerton to present-day Montana, which at the time was part of the Idaho territory, to become chief justice. Edgerton quickly recognized the value of the gold being produced in the Bannack area and the need for this region to have its own territorial government. In 1864, Edgerton returned to Washington to advocate for this idea. On May 26, 1864, Congress created the Montana Territory with Lincoln appointing Edgerton as the first territorial governor.</span></span></p>",

Mining brought in secondary industries like smelters, cement plants, construction, utilities, heavy equipment, and transportation. Unfortunately, these industries damaged the environment. Many Anaconda Mining Company ventures, including the smelters in Black Eagle and Anaconda, along with the Silver Bow Creek/Butte Area, were named Superfund (or abandoned hazardous waste) cleanup sites in the early 1980s by the Environmental Protection Agency. Libby was named a Superfund site because of asbestos mining, while East Helena earned the same designation because of the smelting conducted there by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). Environmental abuses, such as the Berkeley Pit, had a major impact on Montana's 1972 Constitution, which features very strong legal language granting its citizens the right to a clean and healthful environment.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Montana's mining sector transformed its cultural and political history. The Copper Kings’ money influenced state politics heavily and even the location of the capital city. Women, who were allowed to file mining claims and hold their own property, helped Montana elect the first woman to Congress, Jeannette Rankin, in 1916. Jobs drew people to Montana who built and diversified its communities.</span></span></p>",

These railroads allowed the expansion of mining operations with new heavy equipment which had previously not been available in Montana. Miners knew more gold was available but finding it would require digging shafts and tunnels into the hillsides. Quartz mining used large, expensive equipment in order to retrieve the buried gold. Large corporations, such as the Anaconda Company owned by Marcus Daly, were the only ones with the resources to purchase the equipment needed to successfully mine ore from these deep veins. With new equipment to retrieve the ore came the ability to mine many different precious and base metals including gold, silver, copper, zinc, aluminum, iron, lead, tungsten, uranium, platinum, manganese, and cobalt. Butte’s copper deposits became world famous as did the Copper Kings, Marcus Daly and William Clark. These two men owned the largest copper mining interests in Montana and waged war for control of the resources and politics of the state.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Along with these resources, companies started to develop Montana’s mineral resources such as coal, petroleum, natural gas, gypsum, and limestone. Gemstones such as sapphires and garnets were also mined in Montana. With dependable, high capacity haulage introduced by the railroads, and year-round service, Montana's mines grew as did the industries that supported them. Larger, more stable mines and secondary industries created growing and stable communities across Montana. <span>The major stakeholders of these mines and companies were investors from back East. Therefore the mining profits left the state rather than remain in the Montana economy. </span></span></span></p>",

They awoke before dawn, ate breakfast, then hiked to the woods to saw and swing axes in the heat or freezing cold. Injury from falling branches or a crushing death among floating logs during a river drive were job hazards to avoid before returning to camp for dinner at day's end. The men often slept two to a bed in crowded bunkhouses infested by bedbugs without the benefit of a shower, toilet, or laundry facilities. Logging was an exhausting, dangerous, and probably smelly affair.</span></p>\n<p><span>Forester Elers Koch also described the lumberjack life as lonely. “One hears little of laughter and jokes in a logging camp. [The] men eat their enormous meals silently, and sit in the bunkhouse or outside them, tired from the heavy work that goes with the job of man-handling big logs.” The fact that many lumberjacks were immigrants who spoke little English may have contributed to this sense of isolation.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>These men sacrificed home comforts and family life for their paychecks only to be taken advantage of by some lumber companies. Until labor unions could organize it was typical for company sanctioned employment “fees” to whittle away hard earned wages to nearly nothing before the men were fired and replaced by new crews. These unfair practices eventually incited strikes and Montana lumber company owners had to negotiate on pay, workday hours, and logging camp conditions.</span></span></p>",

Railroads, mines, smelters, and towns all used enormous amounts of lumber. Railroads used vast amounts of timber for ties, to brace tunnels, and to support trestles and bridges. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company used more than 200,000 board feet of timber every day in its mines. Smelters burned thousands of cords per day in their smelting processes.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the 1880s, Marcus Daly, who owned the Anaconda Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad, bought up several small lumber companies and created the Montana Improvement Company. This company became one of the most aggressive logging companies, cutting timber wherever they could, including illegally on public lands and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. </span></p>\n<p><span><span>In 1885, the government sued the Montana Improvement Company, saying it had illegally cut $600,000 worth of timber in 1885 alone. Marcus Daly told Congress that 10,000 workers would lose their jobs if the illegal logging stopped. The Northern Pacific Railroad used its power to gain support of Montana’s territorial governor, Samuel T. Hauser. They threatened to remove all railroad money from Hauser’s bank if he did not oppose the federal lawsuits. The lawsuits dragged on for years while illegal logging practices continued in Montana. The massive deforestation of many areas prompted many to call for a better logging management system.</span></span></p>",

Later, cattle drives from Texas brought a large number of stock to Montana following the Civil War. Texas herds had been left untended during the war and had grown beyond the land's grazing limits. Texas ranchers began trailing cattle northward to find new range lands. Many of these drives ended in Montana’s open grasslands. One cowboy, traveling north with a herd of 2,000 cattle, estimated there were 58,000 cattle within eyesight on the trail.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the 1880s, the United States and Europe experienced population booms, which created an even greater demand for beef. The completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1883 enabled Montana ranchers to ship their cattle to markets across the country.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the drier parts of the territory, one cow needed 250 acres of land a year to graze. Some cattle ranches had 10,000 cows, and a few had as many as 40,000. Ranchers required vast amounts of land and water to support this booming industry. It was estimated in the spring of 1885 there were 500,000 cattle in Montana, and overgrazing had become an issue.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The winter of 1886–1887 was one of the most severe winters remembered by the early ranchers. Heavy early snows were followed by a warming trend, which was followed by another severe drop in temperature. Grass was frozen solid under the ice and already exhausted cattle could not paw into the ice to eat. Some estimate that 362,000 cattle or sixty percent of Montana's herds died of starvation that winter.</span></span></p>",

A rancher who claimed a 360 acre homestead with access to water could then use the open range to graze thousands of acres. Ranchers began dividing the Montana Territory into grazing districts, which were managed by ranchers who unofficially claimed a grazing area or \"range.\" Range boundaries and brand descriptions would be published in the nearest local newspapers.</span></p>\n<p><span>The daily work of the cattle ranch was done by cowboys who tended to the cattle. The work of cowboying entailed hard physical labor and required an adventurous spirit. The profession attracted young men—many began as teenagers—who enjoyed working together. Few older men had the stamina to work in the bitter cold of winter and blazing heat of the summer months.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Sheepherders lived in a covered wagons and moved camp and the herd from place to place as the grass was eaten. Sheepherders spent months at a time alone on the range. They travelled by horse, but also put in many miles by foot to keep track of their flocks and protect them from wild animals and disease.</span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span><span>Life on the ranch was often hard. Montana's vast open ranges were ideal for cattle grazing, but this meant that neighbors and cities were few and far between, making family central to the success of the ranch.

The ranching women of Montana were an irreplaceable part of the cattle industry.</span></span></p>",

Natural disasters such as drought and overgrazing, as well as an extremely severe winter in 1886–1887, contributed to the decline of the cattle industry. By 1890, sheep were becoming the predominant stock shipped into Montana.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sheep are historically the second most numerous type of livestock in Montana after cattle. In 1847, Father DeSmet brought sheep to the Bitterroot Valley in western Montana. The industry began to grow in 1869 with the arrival of a band of 1,500 sheep from Oregon in the Beaverhead Valley in the western part of the territory. The first herd in eastern Montana was located in Miles City in 1876. The climate and land were well-suited for sheep, providing a good return on a modest investment.</span></p>\n<p><span>After the decline of the cattle industry following the disastrous winter of 1886–1887, sheep were allowed to graze on land formerly filled with cattle. Acres of land covered with wild forage that could not support cattle turned out to be perfect for sheep. Sheep handled Montana winters well, cost less to raise than cattle, and brought in annual profits from their wool.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Eventually sheep owners turned to winter feeding, relying less on the open range. The majority of sheep were raised east of the Rocky Mountains.</span></span></p>",

In the eastern and central plains of the state, homesteaders grew grains and sugar beets. Many homesteaders planted fields of flax their first year out because it was a crop well suited to the freshly tilled soil. Some farmers used sugar beets as a rotation crop to increase soil productivity. During the early wet years of homesteading, farmers made abundant yields on their grain crops such as wheat and flax. By 1915, crop production was at an all time high in Montana with wheat yielding as much as 25 bushels per acre. By 1920, returning dry weather patterns plunged wheat production to around 2.4 bushels per acre. Because of production issues, many homesteaders lost their farms and moved into towns or out of Montana altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The western section of Montana, on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, generally has a milder climate and more rainfall. Richer soils and more water made these lands sought after for farm production. Producers found that a variety of crops such as grain, hay, and fruit, including apples and cherries, could be grown in this ideal climate and orchards sprang up in many areas. Dry weather patterns impacted western Montana as well and dry years were also less abundant years for crops.</span></span></p>",

They helped build communities, towns, and schools and created cooperatives to provide services to communities in many areas. Homesteaders also supported women's suffrage, helping Montana become the tenth state to grant women the right to vote in 1914. Many women filed claims on homestead lands with some couples even getting divorced so the husband and wife could each claim their own land.</span></p>\n<p><span>Homesteaders shaped Montana politics by helping elect Jeannette Rankin in 1916 as the first congresswoman in the nation and successfully campaigning for prohibition. Homesteaders worked hard to reduce railroad and mining company control of state politics. They helped split the large, sparsely populated counties into smaller ones so local government was more accessible to the people. Smaller counties required more county senators, which gave agricultural communities a stronger voice in state government.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The homesteaders’ contributions, however, were not all positive. They played a large role in displacing Native American people from their reservation lands. When farms did not produce enough food, homesteaders dramatically depleted wildlife numbers through overhunting. Farms also destroyed valuable wildlife habitat further stressing herd numbers.</span></span></p>",

In 1895, Mary Fields became the second woman and the first black woman to work for the US postal service when she was the fastest applicant to hitch a team of six horses. She earned the nickname \"Stagecoach\" because she was so reliable. In 1900, Sarah Bickford inherited her husband's assets including his two-thirds share of the Virginia City Water Company and became the first black woman to operate a utility company.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The US Army employed African American soldiers in segregated regiments. The 25th Infantry regiment was one of four United States Colored Troops regiments in the country. Many companies of the 25th regiment were stationed in Montana forts in the 1880s to assist in maintaining peace with the Indians. In 1896, Lieutenant James A. Moss requested permission to form a bicycle troop staffed with members of the 25th regiment to test the use of bicycles as a military vehicle. Despite some successes and freedoms, the African American population in Montana remained very small. Discrimination persisted and, along with other non-whites, Montana African Americans were excluded from businesses and prevented from voting, often through violent means.</span></span></p>",

Chinese immigrants settled in Montana territory first as miners. Chinese settlements sprang up near mining towns, where Chinese worked abandoned mines searching for any remnants of gold. When the Chinese were successful at mining these played-out claims, they were often accused of stealing. Dan Haffie, an angry miner, committed the first recorded hanging in Butte when he claimed a Chinese man was getting all the luck and hung him from a nearby tree.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The mining boom towns gave the Chinese an opportunity to open businesses such as restaurants, pharmacies, boarding houses, stores, and laundries. The largest Chinese population in Montana was centered in the city of Butte. The labor unions tried to force the Chinese out of town through a series of business boycotts. The first boycott in 1891–1892 failed due to popular support for Chinese businesses. A more organized and aggressive boycott was launched by the labor unions in 1896. Hum Fay, Dr. Huie Pock, and Quon Loy filed suit against the instigators and eventually won an injunction. They were reimbursed their legal fees, but were not able to collect the estimated $500,000 in damages incurred during the boycott from 1896 to 1901. During the boycott, hundreds of Chinese left Butte. Some moved to other Montana communities, but many left the state.</span></span></p>",

Its non-Indian population grew from 20,595 people in 1870 to nearly 143,000 people by 1890. The boom and bust nature of Montana industries kept people on the move. In the silver panic of 1893, Granite silver mine shut down and the nearby mining town of Granite had 3,000 people leave in a single day. Three years later, with silver prices back up, the Granite mine complex was the biggest mine in the world. Today, Granite is a ghost town.</span></p>\n<p><span>Labor Unions were formed to give the workers a voice against the large companies. Unions organized workers to fight for better working conditions and better wages. Unions also provided social gatherings for employees and their families, helped their members when they were sick, and paid for funeral expenses if a man was killed on the job.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The Anaconda Copper Company, called “the company” by the employees, was a huge political power. The company owned the mines, smelters, and many of the state newspapers, and bribed politicians. Men under the control of the company were said to wear the “copper collar.” In 1903, the company shut down, forcing thousands of employees out of work until the legislature passed the legislation it sought. The company also paid men to join the unions and to seek positions of leadership, so eventually they controlled the unions too. Meaderville, McQueen, and East Butte, once thriving Butte neighborhoods, were destroyed so the company could create Berkeley pit.</span></span></p>",
