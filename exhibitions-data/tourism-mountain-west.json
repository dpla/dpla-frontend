Yellowstone National Park, for example, was created as the first national park in 1872 by President Ulysses S. Grant to preserve the geysers and unique geologic features of the area. President Theodore Roosevelt appreciated the grandeur and open spaces he encountered in the West and recognized the need to protect lands for future public use, as well. Roosevelt used his authority to create the US Forest Service to protect and maintain wildlife habitats by establishing bird and game preserves and national parks.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>In 1906, Roosevelt enabled the American Antiquities Act (AAA). The AAA stated that “any person who shall appropriate, excavate, injure, or destroy any historic or prehistoric ruin or monument, or any object of antiquity, situated on lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States” would face fines and possible imprisonment. Roosevelt’s conservation mindedness is reflected in his work to pass the AAA—which enabled the establishment of some of the first national parks—and his general love for nature and the outdoors. Because of his, and other presidents’ foresight, millions of visitors from across the world are able to enjoy nationally protected lands.</span></span></span></span></p>","id":1819,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2675,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/ff663edcb75908713ca804b10985a302.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/ff663edcb75908713ca804b10985a302.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/ff663edcb75908713ca804b10985a302.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/ff663edcb75908713ca804b10985a302.jpg"}}],"id":1819,"caption":"<p>Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir at Glacier Point, Yosemite National Park, California, 1903.

A hot spring occurs when the water is heated above body temperature and brought to the surface. The temperature of the water is attributed to how far into the crust the water travels and is heated by hot rocks. In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, water may be heated by coming into contact with magma. The high temperatures of magma cause the water to boil or become superheated. Hot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near boiling point and are dangerous to swimmers.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Warm springs occur when hot and cold springs mix outside of volcanic areas. Because heated water can hold more dissolved solids, warm and hot springs often have a very high mineral content. Because of folklore and claimed medical value, hot springs are popular tourist destinations and locations for clinics.

Three major mountain building episodes reshaped the west from about 170 to 30 million years ago. The last mountain building event, the Laramide orogeny about 70 to 40 million years ago, is responsible for the raising of the Rocky Mountains. The growth of the Rocky Mountains, far from a subduction zone, may be due to the angle of the subducting oceanic plate being flattened, moving the focus of mountain building farther inland. This increased the friction and other interactions with the continental landmass above it. Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the broad, high Rocky Mountain range.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The east-west orientation of the Uintas may relate to changing stress patterns and rotation of the Colorado Plateau. Both the Rockies and Uintas have been extensively glaciated during the last ice age. Glaciers can still be viewed in Glacier National Park in Montana, but most disappear totally during the summer months due to global environmental changes. The Henry Mountains in Utah formed when molten material from the core of the Earth forced itself upward into the existing layers of crust. Erosion has exposed the hardened molten material which forms the major peaks and the domed and arched sedimentary rocks seen on the flanks of the mountains.</span></span></p>","id":1843,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2712,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/4b4f87d9d245a1dcab908db8d3586e9f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/4b4f87d9d245a1dcab908db8d3586e9f.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/4b4f87d9d245a1dcab908db8d3586e9f.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/4b4f87d9d245a1dcab908db8d3586e9f.jpg"}}],"id":1843,"caption":"<p>\"Looking across fields to rocky mountains behind, ca. 1900-1909.

The layers of the rock visible, such as those at Red Rocks Park in Denver, Colorado, were created in different time periods when the area was flooded by oceans, crisscrossed by rivers, covered by mud flats, and buried by sand. The gradual upward movement raised the iron oxide-rich ledges from ocean floors. These mineral deposits give the sandstone the red color for which they are named.</p>\n<p>Many of these canyons contain Native American artifacts dating back as far as 9,000 to 7,000 years BCE. Some of the canyon walls are decorated with pictographs (painted figures) and petroglyphs (carved figures). These figures document the early human history of the area, including evidence of hunting activities and organized culture. Some of the animals depicted in hunt scenes include mastodons and mammoths. Most tribes in the region were nomadic hunter-gatherers who during more recent times settled and began to cultivate crops such as corn.

Car and train transportation made it easier for people to enjoy a day trip or a few days in the countryside before returning home with a feeling of health and well being after “escaping it all.”</span></span></p>","id":1833,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2690,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/05154cf931a382d8f25f1063e4dc5c8b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/05154cf931a382d8f25f1063e4dc5c8b.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/05154cf931a382d8f25f1063e4dc5c8b.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/05154cf931a382d8f25f1063e4dc5c8b.jpg"}}],"id":1833,"caption":"<p>A small speedboat with spectators on the Provo River, Utah, ca. 1950.

The salinity of the lake (greater than that of oceans) increases swimmers’ typical buoyancy so that they float more easily than in un-salinated water, a fact that draws visitors to the area.

The resort attracted bathers and hosted picnics and dances. It also boasted a giant roller coaster and hosted many concerts.

As the water circulates, the temperature and pressure rise. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying water prevents the water from boiling. As the water rises, steam forms. Bubbling upward, the steam expands as it nears the top of the water column. At a critical point, the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases pressure on the system, and violent boiling results. Tremendous amounts of steam force water out of the vent, and an eruption begins. Water is expelled faster than it can enter the geyser's plumbing system, and the heat and pressure gradually decrease. The eruption stops when the water reservoir is depleted or when the system cools, and the process begins again.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>There are two types of geysers: cone and fountain geysers. A cone-type geyser has a narrow constriction close to the geyser's vent. During eruptions, the constriction acts like a nozzle, causing the water to jet in great columns.
