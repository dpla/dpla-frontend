A hot spring occurs when the water is heated above body temperature and brought to the surface. The temperature of the water is attributed to how far into the crust the water travels and is heated by hot rocks. In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, water may be heated by coming into contact with magma. The high temperatures of magma cause the water to boil or become superheated. Hot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near boiling point and are dangerous to swimmers.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Warm springs occur when hot and cold springs mix outside of volcanic areas. Because heated water can hold more dissolved solids, warm and hot springs often have a very high mineral content. Because of folklore and claimed medical value, hot springs are popular tourist destinations and locations for clinics. Some hot springs have resort areas attached to them to offer services to visitors. Bathing in hot springs is thought to help lower blood pressure, improve sleep and joint mobility, and eliminate toxins from the body.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1852,"caption":"<p>Several men sit in and near a mud bath at Hot Springs, Montana, ca. 1900.

A hot spring occurs when the water is heated above body temperature and brought to the surface. The temperature of the water is attributed to how far into the crust the water travels and is heated by hot rocks. In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, water may be heated by coming into contact with magma. The high temperatures of magma cause the water to boil or become superheated. Hot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near boiling point and are dangerous to swimmers.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Warm springs occur when hot and cold springs mix outside of volcanic areas. Because heated water can hold more dissolved solids, warm and hot springs often have a very high mineral content. Because of folklore and claimed medical value, hot springs are popular tourist destinations and locations for clinics. Some hot springs have resort areas attached to them to offer services to visitors. Bathing in hot springs is thought to help lower blood pressure, improve sleep and joint mobility, and eliminate toxins from the body.</span></span></p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1852,"caption":"<p>Several men sit in and near a mud bath at Hot Springs, Montana, ca. 1900.

The layers of the rock visible, such as those at Red Rocks Park in Denver, Colorado, were created in different time periods when the area was flooded by oceans, crisscrossed by rivers, covered by mud flats, and buried by sand. The gradual upward movement raised the iron oxide-rich ledges from ocean floors. These mineral deposits give the sandstone the red color for which they are named.</p>\n<p>Many of these canyons contain Native American artifacts dating back as far as 9,000 to 7,000 years BCE. Some of the canyon walls are decorated with pictographs (painted figures) and petroglyphs (carved figures). These figures document the early human history of the area, including evidence of hunting activities and organized culture. Some of the animals depicted in hunt scenes include mastodons and mammoths. Most tribes in the region were nomadic hunter-gatherers who during more recent times settled and began to cultivate crops such as corn.

The layers of the rock visible, such as those at Red Rocks Park in Denver, Colorado, were created in different time periods when the area was flooded by oceans, crisscrossed by rivers, covered by mud flats, and buried by sand. The gradual upward movement raised the iron oxide-rich ledges from ocean floors. These mineral deposits give the sandstone the red color for which they are named.</p>\n<p>Many of these canyons contain Native American artifacts dating back as far as 9,000 to 7,000 years BCE. Some of the canyon walls are decorated with pictographs (painted figures) and petroglyphs (carved figures). These figures document the early human history of the area, including evidence of hunting activities and organized culture. Some of the animals depicted in hunt scenes include mastodons and mammoths.

The area was created through intense volcanic and uplift activity whereby the mountains were pushed violently through the surrounding layers of the Earth’s crust. Volcanic activity still exists in the area of Yellowstone National Park, which is a “supervolcano” that could cause eruptions thousand times those of a typical volcano. It is consistently monitored for seismic activity.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The area went through many changes during the ice ages when glaciers carved the landscape. Large ice sheets covered some portions of land and dammed up rivers in others, creating glacial lakes. Many lakes, including Lake Bonneville and the Great Salt Lake, are remnants of the ancient freshwater lake that covered most of the eastern Great Basin. The eastern Mountain West is covered by plateaus and basins where natural resources like minerals, oil, oil shale, and natural gas abound as remnants of the geologic past. Much of the southern and southeastern landscape cuts through layers of sandstone, displaying many colors and shapes developed through years of wind and water erosion. Much of this landscape is part of protected national parks such as Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion, state parks such as Goblin Valley and Monument Valley, and national monuments like Dinosaur National Monument. </span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1822,"caption":"<p>View of the Mittens rock formations in Monument Valley, 1950s.

The area was created through intense volcanic and uplift activity whereby the mountains were pushed violently through the surrounding layers of the Earth’s crust. Volcanic activity still exists in the area of Yellowstone National Park, which is a “supervolcano” that could cause eruptions thousand times those of a typical volcano. It is consistently monitored for seismic activity.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The area went through many changes during the ice ages when glaciers carved the landscape. Large ice sheets covered some portions of land and dammed up rivers in others, creating glacial lakes. Many lakes, including Lake Bonneville and the Great Salt Lake, are remnants of the ancient freshwater lake that covered most of the eastern Great Basin. The eastern Mountain West is covered by plateaus and basins where natural resources like minerals, oil, oil shale, and natural gas abound as remnants of the geologic past.

Tourist encounters with grizzly bears have led to attacks and fatalities. Bison goring of picture-taking tourists has also been known to occur. Attacks of this nature have led to additional warnings for tourists to increase awareness of personal safety issues and precautions, and to respect that natural habitats of the animals that live in the parks and recreational areas. And, while mountain biking does not cause as much damage to areas as ATV usage can, bikers can still cause erosion, destruction of landmarks, and the introduction of noxious plants.</span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1875,"caption":"<p><span>Three men eating next to a campfire in the forest.

Runs are developed by cutting and removing trees, or by using a bulldozer to remove tree stumps and slope irregularity. This process reduces topsoil and causes soil erosion, but remains a popular method because it requires less snow pack in order to open the ski area. </span></p>\n<p><span>Increased soil erosion increases the likelihood of landslides and bared slopes increase avalanche activity. Snow grooming machines and artificial snowmaking cause irreparable damage to soil and vegetation, as some resorts infuse their snow with salt to make the runs faster for skiers. Artificial snowmaking also uses an abundance of water and energy, further stressing resources in an area. Resort development damages local wildlife populations through destruction of habitat.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Many ski areas are developed with the permission of the Forest Service through leases of public lands. Forest Service supervision and increased awareness of protecting the environment have caused ski resorts and visitors to consider the consequences of development. Creating or expanding a ski resort is a long process, involving several preliminary stages of planning before permission to build is given and any work can commence. Developers have to work to ensure the proper environmental precautions are taken, while already developed areas work to decrease their footprint on the environment.</span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1891,"caption":"<p>The slopes around Alta Lodge which have been cleared for ski runs.
