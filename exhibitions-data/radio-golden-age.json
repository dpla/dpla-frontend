We tune in while we drive, while we work, while we cook in our kitchens. Just 100 years ago, it was a novelty to turn on a radio. The radio emerged at the turn of the twentieth century, the result of decades of scientific experimentation with the theory that information could be transmitted over long distances. Radio as a medium reached its peak—the so-called Radio Golden Age—during the Great Depression and World War II. This was a time when the world was rapidly changing, and for the first time Americans experienced those history-making events as they happened. The emergence and popularity of radio shifted not just the way Americans across the country experienced news and entertainment, but also—and more importantly-communicated. This exhibition explores the development, rise, and adaptation of the radio, and its impact on American culture. -->","credits":"This exhibition was created by Hillary Brady, a graduate of Brown University’s Public Humanities M.A. program, as part of her DPLA research assistantship.

Army equipment was primitive, had a very short range, and often negotiated atmospheric interference. A 1913 aircraft with a radio, at the time considered cutting-edge equipment, had a maximum range of 2,000 yards. Military radio equipment also used vacuum tubes, which were heavy and bulky. As a result, the equipment was difficult to tote around on the battlefield, even on mules and horses, which were still the military’s primary mode of equipment transportation. The American army made some adaptations with the development of a \"horse-pack set,\" which used a hand generator and was strapped to the side of a horse.

the country</strong></h4>\n<p>Radio signaled a major shift in how Americans communicated. Once radios became widespread and affordable, they connected people in ways never before possible. By the 1920s, a few decades after Marconi’s first broadcast, half of urban families owned a radio. More than six million stations had been built. The numbers increased rapidly—by 1940, families were listening to their radios for more than four hours each day.</p>\n<p>Radio quickly became a way for American families to stay connected and receive news. This was particularly useful for Americans living in rural areas, which, during the radio's Golden Age, was about half of the country’s population. Before the radio, these isolated towns and families were slow to get the latest news or entertainment. Now, thanks to the radio, they were part of the larger American news and pop-culture phenomena. Particularly after the FCC changed its policy on the number of and space between radio stations after World War II, construction of new broadcast outlets in rural areas meant small towns were getting their own local stations.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting the latest news, in close-to-real time, there quickly became a market for programming geared toward rural families. Though widespread radio features like market reports and weather forecasts had immense importance to farming populations, broadcasters quickly incorporated more agriculturally focused programs. Some were local, like farming lectures broadcast from land grant colleges. Others had a broader audience, like NBC's \"National Farm and Home Hour.\" Even the music aimed at this audience was different—networks began incorporating more folk and “barn dance” programs into their lineups, a break from more urban-focused pop acts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">While radio equipment and programming provided for a growing American market, there were still barriers for many. Especially during the Great Depression, purchasing a radio was a big investment.

Once radios became widespread and affordable, they connected people in ways never before possible. By the 1920s, a few decades after Marconi’s first broadcast, half of urban families owned a radio. More than six million stations had been built. The numbers increased rapidly—by 1940, families were listening to their radios for more than four hours each day.</p>\n<p>Radio quickly became a way for American families to stay connected and receive news. This was particularly useful for Americans living in rural areas, which, during the radio's Golden Age, was about half of the country’s population. Before the radio, these isolated towns and families were slow to get the latest news or entertainment. Now, thanks to the radio, they were part of the larger American news and pop-culture phenomena. Particularly after the FCC changed its policy on the number of and space between radio stations after World War II, construction of new broadcast outlets in rural areas meant small towns were getting their own local stations.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting the latest news, in close-to-real time, there quickly became a market for programming geared toward rural families. Though widespread radio features like market reports and weather forecasts had immense importance to farming populations, broadcasters quickly incorporated more agriculturally focused programs. Some were local, like farming lectures broadcast from land grant colleges. Others had a broader audience, like NBC's \"National Farm and Home Hour.\" Even the music aimed at this audience was different—networks began incorporating more folk and “barn dance” programs into their lineups, a break from more urban-focused pop acts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">While radio equipment and programming provided for a growing American market, there were still barriers for many. Especially during the Great Depression, purchasing a radio was a big investment. While the radio itself might have brought news and pop culture to rural Americans, those who couldn’t afford the price tag of a new set remained unconnected.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":694,"caption":"<p><span>\"Charlie Lingar (coal miner) and his son listen to their battery radio,\" 1946.

A member of the family </strong></h4>\n<p class=\"normal\">The 1950s signaled a change in the Golden Age of radio, with the development and quick popularity of the home television set. The television had been in development since the late 1920s, throughout the rise and dominance of radio. RCA, one of the biggest companies behind the popularization of the radio, poured millions of dollars into developing the television. By 1939, RCA was televising the New York World’s Fair, speeches by President Roosevelt (FDR becoming the first president to appear on a television screen), and baseball games. Still, the technology was primitive. Segments were only about 15 minutes long and used just a single camera to film.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">World War II, with its freeze on commercial television and general technology shortages, delayed the rise of the medium. Before 1947, only a few thousand American homes owned television sets. Just five years later, that number jumped to 12 million. By 1955, half of American homes had a TV set. </p>\n<p class=\"normal\">A study conducted by CBS and Rutgers University during that time, which interviewed families with television sets, found that Americans enjoyed the new experiences television brought them. Families said they felt unified around their new TVs, that it helped parents and children socialize and connect in new ways and helped the family spend more time together. Some described their new TV sets as members of the family. Almost as quickly, the question was raised whether the time that families—particularly children—spent in front of the TV was really such a good thing.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":711,"caption":"<p><span>\"Marshall Hine's Family,\" 1962.

The television had been in development since the late 1920s, throughout the rise and dominance of radio. RCA, one of the biggest companies behind the popularization of the radio, poured millions of dollars into developing the television. By 1939, RCA was televising the New York World’s Fair, speeches by President Roosevelt (FDR becoming the first president to appear on a television screen), and baseball games. Still, the technology was primitive. Segments were only about 15 minutes long and used just a single camera to film.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">World War II, with its freeze on commercial television and general technology shortages, delayed the rise of the medium. Before 1947, only a few thousand American homes owned television sets. Just five years later, that number jumped to 12 million. By 1955, half of American homes had a TV set. </p>\n<p class=\"normal\">A study conducted by CBS and Rutgers University during that time, which interviewed families with television sets, found that Americans enjoyed the new experiences television brought them. Families said they felt unified around their new TVs, that it helped parents and children socialize and connect in new ways and helped the family spend more time together. Some described their new TV sets as members of the family. Almost as quickly, the question was raised whether the time that families—particularly children—spent in front of the TV was really such a good thing.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":711,"caption":"<p><span>\"Marshall Hine's Family,\" 1962.

Vacuum tube radios, which just thirty years ago were bulky and hard to carry, were now smaller. This paved the way for lighter weight, portable, battery-operated transistor radios, encased in metal, for military field use during World War II. In addition to hand-held use by US soldiers on the ground, radios were now an integral part of airplane, submarine, and tank communications. Transmissions went greater distances and were more reliable, and soon became a staple of the war effort.</p>\n<p>In order to make radio transmissions more secure, the US Marines employed Navajo, one of the most complex Native American languages, to send messages during World War II.

Vacuum tube radios, which just thirty years ago were bulky and hard to carry, were now smaller. This paved the way for lighter weight, portable, battery-operated transistor radios, encased in metal, for military field use during World War II. In addition to hand-held use by US soldiers on the ground, radios were now an integral part of airplane, submarine, and tank communications. Transmissions went greater distances and were more reliable, and soon became a staple of the war effort.</p>\n<p>In order to make radio transmissions more secure, the US Marines employed Navajo, one of the most complex Native American languages, to send messages during World War II. The pilot project began with just 30 Navajo “code talkers,” who soon helped develop a virtually uncrackable cipher based in their native language (including \"Moustache Smeller\" as a code name for Adolf Hitler).</p>\n<p>The program was such a success, particularly against the Japanese, that the Navajo code talkers program grew to 420 men.

the rise of radio came new—and some much beloved—entertainment forms, now ready-for-broadcast. The development of the radio mirrored the rise of the gramophone and phonograph, which date back to the turn of the twentieth century. As music increasingly became a focus of radio programming in the 1950s and 1960s, record stores let listeners buy singles or albums they heard on the radio for on-demand listening.</p>\n<p>Entertainment forms like music, and even sporting events, were now easily accessible to anyone with a radio—letting people who might not be able to afford to see a game or show live get a chance to get in on the action. Sports were a particularly good fit for live radio, as they gave people a chance to listen to a game's play-by-play. This play-by-play approach by sports announcers and their color commentator sidekicks dates back to the very beginning of the radio, when Marconi used Morse code to broadcast the results of the America’s Cup back to the <em>New York Herald</em> newsroom. Soon, university football games, prizefights, and baseball games took to the airwaves. By 1922, the Yankees-Giants World Series drew in a record one million radio listeners. Some of the nation’s most recognizable radio personalities were sports announcers, including the Chicago Cubs' Harry Caray and New York sports anchor, Howard Cosell.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Radio also meant that African Americans, who were still restricted by segregation laws throughout the country, could access entertainment that they were barred from seeing in person. In particular, the 1938 heavyweight-boxing match that pitted Joe Louis, the first black heavyweight champion, against a white German opponent named Max Schmeling, brought in a large African American audience. Boxing, like most sports in the United States, was segregated, so it was rare to have both black and white contenders in the same ring. Across the South especially, African Americans gathered around radios to tune into the fight. (Future US President Jimmy Carter remembers listening to the fight as a boy, and putting the radio up to the window so his black neighbors outside could hear it).

The development of the radio mirrored the rise of the gramophone and phonograph, which date back to the turn of the twentieth century. As music increasingly became a focus of radio programming in the 1950s and 1960s, record stores let listeners buy singles or albums they heard on the radio for on-demand listening.</p>\n<p>Entertainment forms like music, and even sporting events, were now easily accessible to anyone with a radio—letting people who might not be able to afford to see a game or show live get a chance to get in on the action. Sports were a particularly good fit for live radio, as they gave people a chance to listen to a game's play-by-play. This play-by-play approach by sports announcers and their color commentator sidekicks dates back to the very beginning of the radio, when Marconi used Morse code to broadcast the results of the America’s Cup back to the <em>New York Herald</em> newsroom. Soon, university football games, prizefights, and baseball games took to the airwaves. By 1922, the Yankees-Giants World Series drew in a record one million radio listeners. Some of the nation’s most recognizable radio personalities were sports announcers, including the Chicago Cubs' Harry Caray and New York sports anchor, Howard Cosell.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Radio also meant that African Americans, who were still restricted by segregation laws throughout the country, could access entertainment that they were barred from seeing in person. In particular, the 1938 heavyweight-boxing match that pitted Joe Louis, the first black heavyweight champion, against a white German opponent named Max Schmeling, brought in a large African American audience. Boxing, like most sports in the United States, was segregated, so it was rare to have both black and white contenders in the same ring. Across the South especially, African Americans gathered around radios to tune into the fight. (Future US President Jimmy Carter remembers listening to the fight as a boy, and putting the radio up to the window so his black neighbors outside could hear it). The fight became one of the largest broadcasts of the decade.</p>\n</div>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":702,"caption":"<p><span>\"Crowd in front of Sturgis Radio store listening to World Series, Los

Beyond the familiar NBC, CBS, and ABC call letters, in its early days television borrowed heavily from radio. Some of the staple radio dramas and serials made their way to television. Even the fifteen-minute format of news programs in television’s early days was modeled after radio newscasts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">As the decade progressed, the medium changed, moving away from radio-style programming to the start of some of television’s most enduring programs: NBC’s <em>Today</em> debuted in 1952, and <em>The Tonight Show</em> in 1953. Sitcoms, which featured recurring characters, became hugely successful. Beyond that, a new and profitable market emerged—children’s television.

Beyond the familiar NBC, CBS, and ABC call letters, in its early days television borrowed heavily from radio. Some of the staple radio dramas and serials made their way to television. Even the fifteen-minute format of news programs in television’s early days was modeled after radio newscasts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">As the decade progressed, the medium changed, moving away from radio-style programming to the start of some of television’s most enduring programs: NBC’s <em>Today</em> debuted in 1952, and <em>The Tonight Show</em> in 1953. Sitcoms, which featured recurring characters, became hugely successful. Beyond that, a new and profitable market emerged—children’s television.
