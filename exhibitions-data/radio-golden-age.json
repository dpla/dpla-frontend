In 1837, Samuel Morse patented his electric telegraph, which showed that it was possible for a telegraphic signal to travel long distances over a wire. By 1864, a physics professor at Cambridge University (England), James Clerk Maxwell, began thinking about electromagnetic waves and distance. He believed that waves could travel fast over long distances and his work set the stage for wireless transmission. Tests were conducted for the next several decades, challenging Maxwell’s theories about distance and speed.</p>\n<div>\n<p>It wasn’t until 1899 that the public got to see this scientific theory in action, when Italian scientist Guglielmo Marconi began using the telegraph to wirelessly announce the results of the America’s Cup races, from a ship at sea, back to New York. Though the technology that made this telegraph possible was the result of many scientists’ contributions, Marconi won the Nobel Prize for his work in 1909, and remains known as the “Father of Radio.” While Marconi’s wireless feat certainly made a splash, and helped Marconi establish his own broadcast company in 1901, radios were still used mostly by engineers and hobbyists. Wireless broadcasts didn’t yet convey sound—they were nothing more than coded dots and dashes, interpreted on the other end to convey a message.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"normal\">All of that changed in 1906, when the first human voice and music recording was sent by Canadian physicist Reginald Fessenden from a station in Massachusetts and heard by listeners as far away as Virginia. The voice and music? Fessenden himself, singing and playing the violin. The radio as we know it had begun to take shape. </p>","id":660,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":844,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/098e4b5d4228e0e6787683f46b044b1e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/098e4b5d4228e0e6787683f46b044b1e.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/098e4b5d4228e0e6787683f46b044b1e.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/098e4b5d4228e0e6787683f46b044b1e.jpg"}}],"id":660,"caption":"<p class=\"p1\">\"Guglielmo Marconi.\" Courtesy The New York Public Library. <span><br /></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"If you have information regarding this image or if you are the copyright holder or their agent giving notice pursuant to The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, please contact DigitalCollections@nypl.org.","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Guglielmo Marconi","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"The New York Public Library\r\nWallach Division: Print Collection.

A landslide victory of Republican nominee Warren G. Harding was due in no small part to the first national election to include women voters, who had recently won the right to suffrage through the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment earlier that year. Election Day, November 2, 1920, also marked the beginning of news radio as we know it today.</p>\n<p>The radio station KDKA, which broadcasted from the rooftop of a Westinghouse Electric building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became the first licensed commercial radio station to produce a news program. Their launch was timed to allow listeners to learn the results of the election closer to real time, without having to wait to read about it in the newspaper.</p>\n<p>After being issued the first-ever radio license by the US Department of Commerce on October 27, 1920, the station chose the KDKA handle—the next set of call letters available on the roster of station identifiers, which were then used for ships and marine stations. After teaming up with the <em>Pittsburgh Post </em>newspaper to get the election results via telephone, their election-night coverage began at 6 pm. With four men on staff, they broadcasted the election results to approximately 1,000 of the nation's first news radio listeners.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">The historic newscast was a hit and ultimately changed the way people received information. It instilled a greater sense of immediacy to the news, as radio shared stories with the public as they unfolded. It helped alter print media, too; instead of writers focusing on simply capturing the headline stories, journalists now had more room to delve into deeper and more complex features. Over the next several decades, scheduled news broadcasts became regular radio features on burgeoning networks, many of which, including ABC, NBC and CBS, still exist today.</p>","id":683,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":940,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/7d2d4f7ee0f936b916a8c127d57e562d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/7d2d4f7ee0f936b916a8c127d57e562d.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/7d2d4f7ee0f936b916a8c127d57e562d.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/7d2d4f7ee0f936b916a8c127d57e562d.jpg"}}],"id":683,"caption":"<p><span>\"KZN Radio Station.\" William Jennings Bryan standing outside Radio Station KZN prior to delivering an address over the air on Oct. 25, 1922.

Army equipment was primitive, had a very short range, and often negotiated atmospheric interference. A 1913 aircraft with a radio, at the time considered cutting-edge equipment, had a maximum range of 2,000 yards. Military radio equipment also used vacuum tubes, which were heavy and bulky. As a result, the equipment was difficult to tote around on the battlefield, even on mules and horses, which were still the military’s primary mode of equipment transportation. The American army made some adaptations with the development of a \"horse-pack set,\" which used a hand generator and was strapped to the side of a horse. The entire radio transmitter and receiver, in size and design, resembled a saddle.</p>\n<p>Still, this did not solve all of radio’s challenges. During the First World War, radio transmissions were often less reliable than using wired telephones or telegraphs. Radio really found a foothold, however, at sea, even before the United States’ direct involvement in World War I. President Wilson’s 1914 Executive Order allowed the Navy to censor international telegrams sent or received via radio. Though many, including the Marconi Wireless Company of America, vehemently challenged the censorship ban, it stuck, and so began the Navy’s heavy involvement with wartime radio. Navy radio stations, which had higher powered signals than those sent out on the frontlines, were able to relay timely wartime news to vessels at sea. There was some experimentation with troop entertainment via radio transmission, too, with broadcasts aimed at Navy ships at sea and wounded sailors recovering in hospitals. It is telling that the U.S. Navy press sent its final dispatch of the war, announcing armistice on November 11, 1918, via radio transmission.</p>","id":671,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":863,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/d1308b2c66bb19c2907da57b3bf48a5b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/d1308b2c66bb19c2907da57b3bf48a5b.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/d1308b2c66bb19c2907da57b3bf48a5b.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/d1308b2c66bb19c2907da57b3bf48a5b.jpg"}}],"id":671,"caption":"<p><span>\"Receiving set for trench radio,\" 1914-1918.

Once radios became widespread and affordable, they connected people in ways never before possible. By the 1920s, a few decades after Marconi’s first broadcast, half of urban families owned a radio. More than six million stations had been built. The numbers increased rapidly—by 1940, families were listening to their radios for more than four hours each day.</p>\n<p>Radio quickly became a way for American families to stay connected and receive news. This was particularly useful for Americans living in rural areas, which, during the radio's Golden Age, was about half of the country’s population. Before the radio, these isolated towns and families were slow to get the latest news or entertainment. Now, thanks to the radio, they were part of the larger American news and pop-culture phenomena. Particularly after the FCC changed its policy on the number of and space between radio stations after World War II, construction of new broadcast outlets in rural areas meant small towns were getting their own local stations.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting the latest news, in close-to-real time, there quickly became a market for programming geared toward rural families. Though widespread radio features like market reports and weather forecasts had immense importance to farming populations, broadcasters quickly incorporated more agriculturally focused programs. Some were local, like farming lectures broadcast from land grant colleges. Others had a broader audience, like NBC's \"National Farm and Home Hour.\" Even the music aimed at this audience was different—networks began incorporating more folk and “barn dance” programs into their lineups, a break from more urban-focused pop acts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">While radio equipment and programming provided for a growing American market, there were still barriers for many. Especially during the Great Depression, purchasing a radio was a big investment. While the radio itself might have brought news and pop culture to rural Americans, those who couldn’t afford the price tag of a new set remained unconnected.</p>","id":694,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":979,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/9b98cb274b9bd0df0f3e9ba51820c1a5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/9b98cb274b9bd0df0f3e9ba51820c1a5.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/9b98cb274b9bd0df0f3e9ba51820c1a5.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/9b98cb274b9bd0df0f3e9ba51820c1a5.jpg"}}],"id":694,"caption":"<p><span>\"Charlie Lingar (coal miner) and his son listen to their battery radio,\" 1946.

The television had been in development since the late 1920s, throughout the rise and dominance of radio. RCA, one of the biggest companies behind the popularization of the radio, poured millions of dollars into developing the television. By 1939, RCA was televising the New York World’s Fair, speeches by President Roosevelt (FDR becoming the first president to appear on a television screen), and baseball games. Still, the technology was primitive. Segments were only about 15 minutes long and used just a single camera to film.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">World War II, with its freeze on commercial television and general technology shortages, delayed the rise of the medium. Before 1947, only a few thousand American homes owned television sets. Just five years later, that number jumped to 12 million. By 1955, half of American homes had a TV set. </p>\n<p class=\"normal\">A study conducted by CBS and Rutgers University during that time, which interviewed families with television sets, found that Americans enjoyed the new experiences television brought them. Families said they felt unified around their new TVs, that it helped parents and children socialize and connect in new ways and helped the family spend more time together. Some described their new TV sets as members of the family. Almost as quickly, the question was raised whether the time that families—particularly children—spent in front of the TV was really such a good thing.</p>","id":711,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":995,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/b7651464ce79df04e223cf392e68ea8f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/b7651464ce79df04e223cf392e68ea8f.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/b7651464ce79df04e223cf392e68ea8f.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/b7651464ce79df04e223cf392e68ea8f.jpg"}}],"id":711,"caption":"<p><span>\"Marshall Hine's Family,\" 1962.

Still, radio was a dominant force for entertainment and information sharing. The rise of the TV changed the way radio broadcasters shaped their content, and, ultimately, what Americans wanted to hear when they tuned in.</p>\n<p>The invention of the commercial transistor radio in 1954 made radio accessible and portable in a way never possible before. The first transistor radio, the Regency TR-1 model, was half a pound and could fit into your pocket. It was powered by a nine-volt battery—a now-standard kind of battery that was originally developed specifically for the transistor radio. Now, listeners didn’t have to sit in their living rooms to hear their favorite music or news program. These new portable radios also created the expectation for easy access to news and entertainment while on the go. Soon, radios were being installed in automobiles for wireless audio on the road.</p>\n<p>Radio broadcasts began to localize and increasingly concentrated on music programming over other entertainment programs, like dramas or comedies, which were popular throughout the early-to-mid twentieth century. Radio was cost-effective and drew in listeners. Between records, stations aired blocks of commercials, as well as live commentary. The radio networks enjoyed the advertising revenue, while the disc jockeys became popular radio personalities. (A 1954 case alleged that DJs were getting more than just notoriety—they were getting paid off by record companies to promote certain albums.) By the end of the 1950s, \"Top 40\" radio had debuted, and the now-big-name acts in rock-and-roll and pop were finding their first audiences on the airwaves. By the mid-1970s, there were still more than 4,000 AM stations and 3,500 FM stations broadcasting across the United States. Though the television had changed the landscape, radio had evolved with it.</p>","id":667,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":851,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/322bceeb0e52bdf93a7dc99061395ff1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/322bceeb0e52bdf93a7dc99061395ff1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/322bceeb0e52bdf93a7dc99061395ff1.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/322bceeb0e52bdf93a7dc99061395ff1.jpg"}}],"id":667,"caption":"<p><span>\"Teenager with radio,\" 1972/1979.

The initial voice transmissions were often erratic and weak, and Fessenden couldn’t find buyers for his new technology.

Other scientists were fast to pick up where he left off, however.</p>\n<p>By 1907, scientists had successfully amplified radio signals. FM (frequency modulation) broadcasts came along more than a decade later, providing a clearer signal than AM (amplitude modulation) stations (though RCA, then in the early stages of developing the television set, kept FM technology to the back burner until the 1940s).</p>\n<p>With clearer signals that spanned longer distances came a demand from the public for new radio programming. The first entertainment broadcasts appeared in the 1910s, coinciding with the development and commercialization of the phonograph. Now, people could hear music on the radio and then buy recordings of it for their at-home phonographs, as they would do with their record players in the 1950s. Formal newscasts began a decade later. By the 1920s, America entered what came to be known as the \"Golden Age of Radio,\" which spanned until the 1950s and the advent of the at-home TV set. It was a time when many television genres we enjoy today found their start as radio staples: soap operas, game shows, variety acts, and mysteries.

For the first time, families listening in heard wartime news in real time. On September 3, 1939, radio listeners heard Britain and France declare war on Germany and speeches by the UK Prime Minister and U.S. President Roosevelt as they happened. When the United States officially entered the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, listeners got an even fuller picture of what life was like on the battlefront. Most notably, award-winning journalist Edward R. Murrow became part of CBS News' efforts to bring the realities of the war back home through on-the-ground radio reporting. Murrow became famous for reporting live from London during the nine-month Nazi bombing campaign called the \"Blitz.\"</p>\n<p>Radio addresses from the front were coupled with broadcasts from leaders of the warring nations. Roosevelt’s fireside chats, which began in 1933 and lasted until 1944, became an intimate way for the president to directly communicate with radio listeners across the United States. During the war, the president was able to speak about the declaration of war and its progress, the US economy, and the movement toward peace. The concept and format allowed listeners to feel like the president was in their homes talking to them, letting them know they were going to make it through some of the nation’s toughest times.</p>\n<p>The war also influenced radio entertainment broadcasts, becoming a topic in radio serials and soap operas, often with racially charged caricatures of the Axis powers playing the villains. Government-sponsored broadcasts featured Hollywood celebrities sharing the virtues of collecting scrap metal and planting Victory gardens. Children’s programming was no exception. Boys and girls listening to the popular <em>Dick Tracy</em> series were urged to fight the enemy by pledging to save water, gas and electricity, and to \"save my playthings\" as well as \"Mom's furniture.\"</p>","id":678,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":965,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/b6c2c5aa6d8a3d96e79df969a1912b89.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/b6c2c5aa6d8a3d96e79df969a1912b89.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/b6c2c5aa6d8a3d96e79df969a1912b89.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/b6c2c5aa6d8a3d96e79df969a1912b89.jpg"}}],"id":678,"caption":"<p><span>\"They Need Your Old Radio And Parts,\" 1942-1943.

Networks began to establish their own permanent news bureaus in major cities. In fact, in 1933, CBS started placing correspondents in every American city with a population of 20,000 or more, in addition to many foreign capitals. Radio journalism soon hinged on live coverage of everything from sporting events and political speeches, to major court trials.</p>\n<p>The popularity and expansion of broadcast news meant that journalists had new roles as commentators and on-air reporters. News radio became the go-to source of information, for stories at home and abroad. By 1939, a poll estimated that more than 25 percent of Americans relied on the radio as their main source for news. A few years later, in 1946, it was up to more than 60 percent. This was coupled with the introduction of broadcast advertising in 1922, making radio programming an incredibly profitable market—and a new communication force to be reckoned with. By 1928, the Republican Party was spending more than 20 percent of its overall presidential campaign budget on radio advertising.</p>\n<p>Broadcast news programs and journalists soon joined the rising ranks of radio entertainment personalities. Moreover, these men and women had a role in helping Americans engage with the news in a way they never had before—giving them a chance to hear a variety of opinions, engage with the news in real-time, and listen to and analyze politicians in a new, dynamic way. </p>","id":689,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":975,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/51b46857d433cf1fcfa3391a1761e84a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/51b46857d433cf1fcfa3391a1761e84a.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/51b46857d433cf1fcfa3391a1761e84a.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/51b46857d433cf1fcfa3391a1761e84a.jpg"}}],"id":689,"caption":"<p>\"Eleanor Roosevelt Radio Interview, 1947.\" Courtesy Arizona Jewish Historical Society, via Mountain West Digital Library. </p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Property of Arizona Jewish Historical Society.

The development of the radio mirrored the rise of the gramophone and phonograph, which date back to the turn of the twentieth century. As music increasingly became a focus of radio programming in the 1950s and 1960s, record stores let listeners buy singles or albums they heard on the radio for on-demand listening.</p>\n<p>Entertainment forms like music, and even sporting events, were now easily accessible to anyone with a radio—letting people who might not be able to afford to see a game or show live get a chance to get in on the action. Sports were a particularly good fit for live radio, as they gave people a chance to listen to a game's play-by-play. This play-by-play approach by sports announcers and their color commentator sidekicks dates back to the very beginning of the radio, when Marconi used Morse code to broadcast the results of the America’s Cup back to the <em>New York Herald</em> newsroom. Soon, university football games, prizefights, and baseball games took to the airwaves. By 1922, the Yankees-Giants World Series drew in a record one million radio listeners. Some of the nation’s most recognizable radio personalities were sports announcers, including the Chicago Cubs' Harry Caray and New York sports anchor, Howard Cosell.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Radio also meant that African Americans, who were still restricted by segregation laws throughout the country, could access entertainment that they were barred from seeing in person. In particular, the 1938 heavyweight-boxing match that pitted Joe Louis, the first black heavyweight champion, against a white German opponent named Max Schmeling, brought in a large African American audience. Boxing, like most sports in the United States, was segregated, so it was rare to have both black and white contenders in the same ring. Across the South especially, African Americans gathered around radios to tune into the fight. (Future US President Jimmy Carter remembers listening to the fight as a boy, and putting the radio up to the window so his black neighbors outside could hear it). The fight became one of the largest broadcasts of the decade.</p>\n</div>","id":702,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":987,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/80f3d818c48fd3c40235923e8906f7cf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/80f3d818c48fd3c40235923e8906f7cf.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/80f3d818c48fd3c40235923e8906f7cf.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/80f3d818c48fd3c40235923e8906f7cf.jpg"}}],"id":702,"caption":"<p><span>\"Crowd in front of Sturgis Radio store listening to World Series, Los Angeles, CA, 1929.\" Courtesy University of Southern California Libraries. <span><br /></span></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"\"Crowd in front of Sturgis Radio store listening to World Series, Los Angeles, CA, 1929.","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"36d36c106b5304cd162f5d3db910f2a3","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"For uses other than private, contact USC Libraries Special Collections at the e-mail given\r\nContact: Special Collections, Doheny Memorial Library, USC Libraries, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0189; specol.edu; phone (213) 821-2366; fax (213) 740-2343\r\nUSC Libraries Special Collections\r\nDoheny Memorial Library, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0189\r\nSpecol@usc.edu","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"3 photographs of men in front of Sturgis Radio store listening to World Series, Los Angeles, CA, 1929. \"Subject: crowd in front of Sturgis Radio store listening to World Series, Client: Majestic Radio, Ungar Watson; Year: 1929; Job: 10-11-73\"--on envelope front. \"Operator's Report: Davey; Original Photographs: 3, 8x10; Amount: 3.00; Extra Charges: Bouldin\"--in envelope back.","element":{"name":"Description","id":41},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Dick Whittington Studio","element":{"name":"Creator","id":39},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"University of Southern California.

This experimental attitude did not end with Marconi, however. Though the basics of how we use radio today were established in the early 1900s, amateur experimentation with the medium continued through the twentieth century.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Before the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em>, amateur radio broadcasters were often unregulated. Users picked their own call letters and worked without a license. After the <em>Titanic</em> sank, and was unable to reach another ship’s radio operator for help because the receiver had been turned off for the evening, new radio laws were put into place. Part of the Radio Act of 1912, beyond mandating that radios had to be constantly monitored, created new licensing regulations. The bill essentially kicked amateur radio broadcasters off the professionally used and mandated long radio waves. That brought them back to the experimental level again, working on shorter wavelengths.</p>\n<p>By 1922, amateur radio operators, pushing for recognition amidst rumors that the big networks were trying to silence them, issued a definition for themselves. They determined an amateur radio operator as \"one who operates a radio station, transmitting or receiving, without pay or personal gain, merely for personal interest.\" Their better-known title, \"ham\" radio operators (originally a derisive label taken from the equally pejorative \"ham actor\"), gained popularity in the 1950s, along with a new rise in amateur radio operators. In a move to formally stake a claim on the airwaves, the first amateur radio satellite OSCAR (Orbiting Satellites Carrying Amateur Radio) was launched in 1961.</p>","id":698,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":983,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/0e436fcb24e81c127bceb3afa7943bb0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/0e436fcb24e81c127bceb3afa7943bb0.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/0e436fcb24e81c127bceb3afa7943bb0.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/0e436fcb24e81c127bceb3afa7943bb0.jpg"}}],"id":698,"caption":"<p>\"First Ham Radio Set,\" ca. 1921.

And while radio did create larger audiences for the work of black musicians, from its inception, black musicians and their work played on the radio to primarily white audiences.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">For rural African Americans in the US South (which accounted for about 80 percent of the nation’s black population between WWI and WWII), access to radio itself had its limits. While more and more white families could afford radios, it was still a heavy financial burden for African Americans. A 1935 poll of sharecroppers living in North and South Carolina showed that few, if any, black families owned a radio. In the 1940s, while nearly 80 percent of white rural families nationwide owned radios, only about 20 percent of rural blacks did. Even though radio broadcasters made some steps to integrate African American artists into their lineups, pre-WWII audiences were overwhelmingly white.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">At the same time, the racism prevalent throughout the country was also present in radio programming. African American men and women in the radio industry found stark limitations on what jobs they could or could not hold. For example, black actors were often confined to voicing black caricatures on radio dramas. Racist stereotypes, often derived from minstrel shows, were widespread during radio’s Golden Age programming.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">By the 1950s and 1960s, more localized programming, created for and by African Americans, helped create a stronger voice for blacks on the radio. Post WWII, marketers recognized that African Americans were a sizeable consumer market, and radio broadcasters took notice, too. New programming blocks aimed at black listeners were created. Many local urban stations made their home in Harlem and blacks began owning shares in Southern stations.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">NBC issued its new code of standards in 1951, which included “integration without identification,” regularly using African American actors in non-black roles. NBC said the new policy increased the use of black talent on the radio by 200 percent over the course of a single year. Moreover, the emergence of radio DJs in the 1960s and 1970s meant that popular rock, blues, and jazz music, which often featured African American musicians, were heard by a wider audience—both black and white—in a way never possible before. </p>","id":706,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":991,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/893a3257a0a4b978fdadd4a05f7fd937.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/893a3257a0a4b978fdadd4a05f7fd937.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/893a3257a0a4b978fdadd4a05f7fd937.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/893a3257a0a4b978fdadd4a05f7fd937.jpg"}}],"id":706,"caption":"<p><span>\"The staff of 'The California Eagle Hour' prepare for their weekly radio broadcast, circa 1940, Los Angeles.\" Courtesy University of Southern California Libraries. </span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"\"The staff of 'The California Eagle Hour' prepare for their weekly radio broadcast, circa 1940, Los Angeles.\"","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"cff6bf83de8d484089556a63a139da11","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Copyright has not been assigned to the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research\r\nResearchers may make single copies of images solely for the purpose of private study.

The first major television news events were the 1952 Democratic and Republican conventions. Walter Cronkite, one of the first television news anchors, covered the conventions for CBS. In future elections, television coverage became a major focus for the party conventions and soon, the race for president itself.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Many, in fact, credit television in part for the election of President John F. Kennedy. During a televised debate with Richard Nixon, Kennedy came across as a much more viable—and photogenic—candidate. In polls following the debate, Americans who watched on TV thought Kennedy won the debate. Those who listened on the radio considered Nixon the winner. But by 1960, television news was king. As President Lyndon B. Johnson said in 1968, “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost middle America.”</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">While television carved out a substantial role for itself in politics and entertainment, radio adapted. Where early radio was primarily one-sided, with a host talking to an audience, call in talk-shows emerged in the 1960s allowing listeners to interact with the content. Many of these new talk shows were political in nature, with conservative and liberal bents, appealing to more specialized audiences.  The 1980s also saw the emergence of the “shock jock,” a DJ who pushed the boundaries of accepted speech and content on the radio.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Radio, in its many iterations, from “Top 40,” NPR, Rush Limbaugh, to satellite and Internet based programming, continues to adapt and find new audiences. As NBC’s vice president in charge of radio announced in 1954, “Radio didn’t die. It wasn’t even sick. It just had to be psychoanalyzed . . . .The public didn’t stop loving radio despite TV. It just started liking it in a different way—and radio went to the beach, to the park, the patio and the automobile . . . Radio has become a companion to the individual.”</p>","id":717,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1001,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/528fda53fca9ca157d7ede2344ac2ac3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/528fda53fca9ca157d7ede2344ac2ac3.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/528fda53fca9ca157d7ede2344ac2ac3.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/528fda53fca9ca157d7ede2344ac2ac3.jpg"}}],"id":717,"caption":"<p>\"President Lyndon B.

Beyond the familiar NBC, CBS, and ABC call letters, in its early days television borrowed heavily from radio. Some of the staple radio dramas and serials made their way to television. Even the fifteen-minute format of news programs in television’s early days was modeled after radio newscasts.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">As the decade progressed, the medium changed, moving away from radio-style programming to the start of some of television’s most enduring programs: NBC’s <em>Today</em> debuted in 1952, and <em>The Tonight Show</em> in 1953. Sitcoms, which featured recurring characters, became hugely successful. Beyond that, a new and profitable market emerged—children’s television. While there were radio programs aimed at children before, now shows like ABC’s <em>The Mickey Mouse Club</em> gained immense popularity. It was an advertising boon for networks, too, who created blocks of scheduling just for children. Children became a new mass market. They saw, for example, Disney’s <em>Davy Crockett</em> on television and got their parents to buy $300 million dollars worth of merchandise, including the iconic coonskin cap.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">More than television just being a way to advertise new products to children, it was marketing the very medium itself. A 1950 study gauging the opinions of children, parents, and teachers saw a growing segment of children who wanted to pursue careers in new video-related fields. Indeed, television opened up a completely new job landscape for Americans looking to tap into the country’s next big communication medium.</p>","id":714,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":998,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/9597b54785d681a8cde9a78bf3461390.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/9597b54785d681a8cde9a78bf3461390.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/9597b54785d681a8cde9a78bf3461390.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/9597b54785d681a8cde9a78bf3461390.jpg"}}],"id":714,"caption":"<p><span>\"Television cameras.\" Courtesy Brigham Young University-Idaho, via Mountain West Digital Library. </span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"\"Television cameras.\" ","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"164cf9f8f09435184034210feb4532b5","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Public","element":{"name":"Rights","id":47},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"Mountain West Digital Library\r\nBrigham Young University-Idaho","element":{"name":"Source","id":48},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":811204}}]},{"text":null,"id":715,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":999,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/125a8243022dc79f67666866db89b6e6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/125a8243022dc79f67666866db89b6e6.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/125a8243022dc79f67666866db89b6e6.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/125a8243022dc79f67666866db89b6e6.jpg"}}],"id":715,"caption":"<p>\"Barbara Whiting and Margaret Whiting on the Ed Sullivan Show,\" 1957.
