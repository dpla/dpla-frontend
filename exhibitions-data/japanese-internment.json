Pre-existing racial tensions and “yellow peril” hysteria magnified as the American public grew increasingly suspicious of Japanese Americans and uncertain of their loyalty. They were regarded as potential spies and anti-Japanese propaganda quickly spread.</p>\n<p>Then, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry (two-thirds of whom were US citizens) were forced to evacuate from their homes and report to assembly centers. From there, they were moved to one of ten internment camps, or War Relocation Centers, located in remote areas of seven states—California, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas.</p>\n<p>For the next three years, Japanese Americans acclimated to life behind barbed wire and under armed guard. Uprooted from their lives, they found themselves in strange and uncomfortable environments. They had to adapt to their new situation by adjusting to new living conditions, attending new schools, and finding inventive ways to pass the time. They attempted to maintain a sense of normalcy by attending religious meetings and by finding employment.</p>\n<p>This exhibition tells stories of everyday lives in Japanese Internment camps during World War II.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":969,"caption":"<p><span>A portrait of Dave Tatsuno and his family at Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah, 1945.

Pre-existing racial tensions and “yellow peril” hysteria magnified as the American public grew increasingly suspicious of Japanese Americans and uncertain of their loyalty. They were regarded as potential spies and anti-Japanese propaganda quickly spread.</p>\n<p>Then, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry (two-thirds of whom were US citizens) were forced to evacuate from their homes and report to assembly centers. From there, they were moved to one of ten internment camps, or War Relocation Centers, located in remote areas of seven states—California, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas.</p>\n<p>For the next three years, Japanese Americans acclimated to life behind barbed wire and under armed guard. Uprooted from their lives, they found themselves in strange and uncomfortable environments. They had to adapt to their new situation by adjusting to new living conditions, attending new schools, and finding inventive ways to pass the time.

On this “date which will live in infamy,” the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This surprise attack further motivated the US government to officially enter World War II.</p>\n<p>The day after Pearl Harbor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began arresting Japanese men—many of whom were leaders in their communities—who had been placed on a Department of Justice watch list. Within forty-eight hours, over a thousand Japanese men were taken into custody and jailed. Just as swiftly, the US Government began to distribute xenophobic war propaganda that placed the Japanese at the top of America’s list of enemies. Using offensive racial stereotypes, this propaganda (which permeated American media throughout the war) was used to alienate and vilify the Japanese as a whole.</p>\n<p>Japanese American loyalty soon became a core issue for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. Many Japanese men and women were even forced to take loyalty tests that included questions about their belief in Japanese culture and their allegiance to the United States. These loyalty tests included scenarios that asked what the test-taker would do if he or she had suspicions about a hypothetical neighbor and requests for references to “vouch for your conduct.”</p>\n<p>The Western Defense Command general, General John L. DeWitt, classified Japanese and Japanese Americans alike as “an enemy race,” and soon changes to their civil rights reflected that. It would be the only moment in US history when the federal government effectively nullified citizenship on grounds of racial difference.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":997,"caption":"<p>A war poster reading \"Don't blab.

On this “date which will live in infamy,” the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This surprise attack further motivated the US government to officially enter World War II.</p>\n<p>The day after Pearl Harbor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began arresting Japanese men—many of whom were leaders in their communities—who had been placed on a Department of Justice watch list. Within forty-eight hours, over a thousand Japanese men were taken into custody and jailed. Just as swiftly, the US Government began to distribute xenophobic war propaganda that placed the Japanese at the top of America’s list of enemies. Using offensive racial stereotypes, this propaganda (which permeated American media throughout the war) was used to alienate and vilify the Japanese as a whole.</p>\n<p>Japanese American loyalty soon became a core issue for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. Many Japanese men and women were even forced to take loyalty tests that included questions about their belief in Japanese culture and their allegiance to the United States. These loyalty tests included scenarios that asked what the test-taker would do if he or she had suspicions about a hypothetical neighbor and requests for references to “vouch for your conduct.”</p>\n<p>The Western Defense Command general, General John L. DeWitt, classified Japanese and Japanese Americans alike as “an enemy race,” and soon changes to their civil rights reflected that. It would be the only moment in US history when the federal government effectively nullified citizenship on grounds of racial difference.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":997,"caption":"<p>A war poster reading \"Don't blab.
