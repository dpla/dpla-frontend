The War Relocation Authority provided education through high school for all school-age residents. However, camp school houses were crowded, with a student-teacher ratio of up to 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools. This rating was high, particularly when compared to the national average of 28:1. Educational staff rarely exceeded five women and seven men in a basic school system that enrolled 1,774 pupils.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Many internment camps had multiple schools to educate the numerous children detained there. Often entire blocks of barracks were converted for grade school classrooms, but they were ‘prison-esque’ blocks that contained few windows. When temperatures rose and the schoolhouse was filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. The makeshift schoolhouses were never intended for long-term use. And without adequate funding, school supplies and equipment were always in short supply.</span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span></span></p>",

Not only was it a way for them to pass the time and to earn a wage, but also internee employment was necessary for the everyday operations of the camps. The majority worked full-time, usually around forty-four hours per week. At first, internees were not paid for their work, but this later changed. Rates of pay varied depending on the type of work performed and the skill of the worker. For instance, professional and technical work would earn sixteen dollars per month, a mid-range rate was twelve dollars per month for skilled work, and the lowest rate was eight dollars per month for unskilled work. As an added benefit, internees who worked were given a clothing credit of $3.75 month.</p>\n<p>Before life in the camps, Japanese Americans made much more money than they did while interned. They also made significantly less than their Caucasian counterparts who staffed the camps. For example, internee teachers at Heart Mountain Relocation Center were paid $228 per year while base salaries for Caucasian instructors set at $2,000 per year.</p>",

A 1943 War Relocation Authority report describes internee housing as \"tar paper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind.\" Most of the camps were built quickly during the summer of 1942 and their design was based on military barracks. Throughout many camps, twenty-five people were forced to live in space built to contain four, which gave no privacy.</p>\n<p>Family apartments were typically single twenty by twenty-four foot rooms with external bathrooms, showers, and laundry shared by a larger group. These rooms had little insulation save wood stoves in cold weather, and poor ventilation in the heat. In such close quarters, diseases like typhoid, dysentery, and smallpox spread quickly across the camp and forced understaffed and undersupplied medical centers to put most of their resources toward vaccinations. High incidence of food poisoning and other illnesses also contributed to unsanitary conditions in shared bathroom facilities.</p>\n<p>Though families attempted to cope with their situation, when later surveyed about their experiences, “living conditions” was the number one response to the question asking what the most difficult part of the experience was.</p>",

Pre-existing racial tensions and “yellow peril” hysteria magnified as the American public grew increasingly suspicious of Japanese Americans and uncertain of their loyalty. They were regarded as potential spies and anti-Japanese propaganda quickly spread.</p>\n<p>Then, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry (two-thirds of whom were US citizens) were forced to evacuate from their homes and report to assembly centers. From there, they were moved to one of ten internment camps, or War Relocation Centers, located in remote areas of seven states—California, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Arkansas.</p>\n<p>For the next three years, Japanese Americans acclimated to life behind barbed wire and under armed guard. Uprooted from their lives, they found themselves in strange and uncomfortable environments. They had to adapt to their new situation by adjusting to new living conditions, attending new schools, and finding inventive ways to pass the time. They attempted to maintain a sense of normalcy by attending religious meetings and by finding employment.</p>\n<p>This exhibition tells stories of everyday lives in Japanese Internment camps during World War II.</p>",

By 1946, all of the camps that forcibly held Japanese Americans were closed.</span></p>\n<p><span>What those thousands of men and women found when they returned, however, was that the lives they left were no longer available to them. Workers lost their jobs during deportation, and families had lost their homes and property to opportunists who had seized them in their absence. It would be another thirty years before the men and women who survived internment were offered any formal apology by the United States government.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the \"Redress Movement\" of the 1960s and 70s, Japanese internment once again gained national attention. Thanks to the activism of many young Japanese Americans, President Gerald Ford officially rescinded Roosevelt’s Executive Order in 1976, calling internment a \"national mistake.\"</span></p>\n<p><span>Four years later, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which studied Japanese internment and held hearings across the country. Their findings, called </span><em>Personal Justice Denied</em><span>, described internment as  a \"grave injustice\" rooted in prejudice. The Civil Liberties Act in 1988 later issued $20,000 to each surviving internee as a redress for their experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, each of the ten detention sites are now historical landmarks, where the experiences and lasting legacy of the Japanese American immigrants and citizens forcibly detained by the government are remembered and recognized.</span></p>",

Since camp administrators could not enforce the religious needs of internees, both religions flourished in the camps.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Camp religious centers and organizations were multifunctional. Buildings differed in size and quality, and often served multiple purposes. Regardless of the space’s condition, camp religious centers provided community, education, and even amenities.

Camp religious spaces served not only as important physical places, they also played a vital psychological role as safe spaces for internees.</span></span></p>",

Of the approximately 200,000 who first relocated to Hawaii, nearly all later moved to the West Coast of the US mainland to do agricultural work and operate small businesses. A pact between Japan and the United States in 1908 put a ban on unskilled immigrant laborers, slowing the influx of Japanese men and women relocating. These first-generation Japanese immigrants (known as Issei) and their American-born children (known as Nisei) still thrived in the face of a climate of racism and distrust that permeated US culture.</p>\n<p>From the time of their arrival in the United States, Japanese immigrants, and other Asian immigrant groups, faced systematic discrimination from the American government and public. The Japanese and Korean Exclusion League (which later became the Asiatic Exclusion League) was established in May 1905. Other organizations followed, like the Anti-Jap Laundry League in 1908, which was formed by laundry worker unions with slogans asserting their need to maintain “the white man's standard in a white man's country” by boycotting Japanese-run laundries. Other organizations, like the Native Sons of the Golden West, would take anti-Japanese stances throughout the early 1900s, asserting that they needed to protect a California “given by God to a white people.” Legislation banned Japanese Americans from owning land or property, and laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Immigration Act of 1924 banned \"undesirable\" immigration from Asian countries, including Japan.</p>",

On this “date which will live in infamy,” the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This surprise attack further motivated the US government to officially enter World War II.</p>\n<p>The day after Pearl Harbor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began arresting Japanese men—many of whom were leaders in their communities—who had been placed on a Department of Justice watch list. Within forty-eight hours, over a thousand Japanese men were taken into custody and jailed. Just as swiftly, the US Government began to distribute xenophobic war propaganda that placed the Japanese at the top of America’s list of enemies. Using offensive racial stereotypes, this propaganda (which permeated American media throughout the war) was used to alienate and vilify the Japanese as a whole.</p>\n<p>Japanese American loyalty soon became a core issue for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. Many Japanese men and women were even forced to take loyalty tests that included questions about their belief in Japanese culture and their allegiance to the United States. These loyalty tests included scenarios that asked what the test-taker would do if he or she had suspicions about a hypothetical neighbor and requests for references to “vouch for your conduct.”</p>\n<p>The Western Defense Command general, General John L. DeWitt, classified Japanese and Japanese Americans alike as “an enemy race,” and soon changes to their civil rights reflected that. It would be the only moment in US history when the federal government effectively nullified citizenship on grounds of racial difference.</p>",

Its logic dictated that when Japanese Americans were kept under surveillance, restricted from using traditional communication, and physically removed from bustling coastal cities that were geographically closer to Japan, they were less capable of assisting in another attack on US shores.</p>\n<p>In just a few months, Japanese American families on the West Coast were forced to leave their homes behind and begin the long process of deportation. First came curfews and then bulletins posted in public areas informing them when residents from particular areas should report for evacuation and instructing them to bring only bedding, clothing, and personal effects. From March through May 1942, Japanese Americans were quickly assembled and removed from areas in Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington, where they owned property, attended schools, and had built communities for decades. Families were forced to abandon their homes, pets, furniture, and other items that would not make the journey with them. Japanese deportation and incarceration was supported by many white farmers who resented Japanese American farmers. Even more sympathetic neighbors and teachers did little to stop the removal of the Japanese Americans who lived among them.</p>",

If anyone made noise during the night, as often happened with young children, it disturbed everyone. The toilet facilities were described as a pit with boards, the stench was overwhelming and sanitation was poor. Preparations were not made to properly accommodate the prisoners. These centers were a radical transition from the comfortable homes internees had left days before.</p>\n<p>Through the summer of 1942, evacuees were sent by train from assembly centers to ten War Relocation Centers in undesirable areas in the interior: Minidoka (Idaho), Heart Mountain (Wyoming), Manzanar (California), Tule Lake (California), Granada (Colorado), Topaz (Utah), Gila River (Arizona), Poston (Arizona), Rohwer (Arkansas), and Jerome (Arkansas). As they traveled by train, they saw their familiar landscapes give way to the harsh climates of desolate mountains, deserts, and swamps. Approaching the camps, they saw that their new homes were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards in towers. As the train pulled in, internees were confronted with the full extent of their new isolation.</p>",

          "text": "<p>Before the war, family was the key social unit for Japanese Americans. Incarceration in the camps greatly affected family dynamics and placed new pressures on family units. Men were traditionally the patriarchal leaders of the family, running small businesses or farms, and this authority was eroded by life in the camps, causing a disruption in deeply ingrained familial roles, relationships, and identities. More broadly, social networks that developed before mass incarceration were splintered, as neighbors, friends, and coworkers were sent to different relocation centers. The break-up of these informal social infrastructures is one of many little-perceived and long-term hardships that internment had on family and social life for Japanese Americans.</p>\n<p>Tensions between first (Issei) and second (Nisei) generations within families were exacerbated by the incarceration. And, the work of organizations like the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), which collaborated with federal authorities to identify disloyalty, added to the feelings of disconnectedness. The JACL encouraged Nisei children to rebel against their Issei parents by offering patriotic, Americanized activities. These generational tensions were further aggravated in 1943 by government pressure on Nisei to enlist in the US military and adults to complete a loyalty questionnaire that demanded that Japanese Americans renounce their connections to Japan. People who refused to take the questionnaire—or “failed”—were relocated with their families to the Tule Lake Segregation Center—a special camp for internees deemed especially politically dangerous. Differing attitudes towards loyalty, tradition, enlistment, and the questionnaire tore many Japanese American families apart.</p>",

Japanese families were typically patriarchal in structure, and this changed under internment. When men were no longer the economic centers of the household, the traditional identities of men and women were reconfigured, along with the long-established gendered division of labor. Marriage and childbearing were also delayed by separation and other circumstances, which changed the timeline of independence for single women.</p>\n<p>A former prisoner whose father was taken away recalls the impact it had on her sister and mother. Her sister went from being a pampered child to the head of the household. These kinds of transitions gave women greater power within the family unit and children adult responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties of familial upheaval and the dehumanization of imprisonment, there were long-term changes in the lives of Japanese American women that some see as ultimately advantageous. Small living spaces and collectivization of tasks such as meal preparation, laundry, and child care, lessened women’s domestic duties. In some ways these were positive changes for women, freeing up young women for education, and older women for wage-earning positions. But greater power sometimes came at a cost: separation from beloved male family members or the loss of a care-free childhood.</p>",

It was not unusual for schools to be staffed by both Japanese and Caucasian teachers. Caucasian teachers were expected to live year-round in the camps and work a longer week to accommodate a larger class size.</span></p>\n<p><span>Japanese American instructors also staffed primary and secondary schools, which gave them the freedom to design their own curricula in math, science, English, and social studies—within limits. The War Relocation Authority requested that Americanization classes be a part of the camp schooling. These classes focused on indoctrinating the younger generation of Japanese Americans with “American” values that would ensure their loyalty and best prepare them for an assimilated life after the war.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Learning and respecting teachers were integral parts of Japanese culture. Students wore clean uniforms despite their living situations. The community school philosophy was designed to benefit each student as well as the community because education was perceived as a tool with which to improve a student’s quality of life. In camp schools, students gained specific skills for future employment, as well as an understanding of traditional academic concepts like the scientific method and newly emphasized democratic principles.</span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span></span></p>",

Sports, especially baseball, united camp residents and drew large crowds eager to recapture a small part of their pre-war lives. High school and community teams played against each other, as well as against non-camp teams. Camp newspapers devoted full pages to sports scores, which internees followed religiously. At the Topaz Camp, men over 50 years-old played against a girls’ softball team. Camp guards also participated in the games. Photographer Ansel Adams, who was determined to discover how “these human beings suffering under great injustice overcame a sense of despair and defeat,” found that the key was baseball.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Once baseball season ended in October, internees turned to fall sports like football. Teams consisted of six to seven men and the intensity varied from camp to camp. A few college-age Nisei (American-born Japanese) transferred to colleges outside the camp to play collegiate football. Among them was Chester (Chet) Maeda who was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 1943.</span></span></p>",

By the end of 1943, the camps produced eighty-five percent of their own vegetables, all of the camps raised hogs, and several of them raised chickens. In addition, four of the camps produced their own beef by raising cattle, and the Gila River camp in Arizona ran its own dairy.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Japanese internees also made a significant contribution to the nation’s economy in terms of agriculture. Due to a labor shortage in 1942, some internees were temporarily released to perform seasonal farm work. Sugar beet crops in the western part of the country, for example, were saved from wartime neglect by the work of Japanese evacuees on seasonal leave. In the Arkansas camps, Jerome and Rohwer, internees cleared and drained thousands of acres of land and worked in sawmills.</span></p>",

Missionaries had been building relationships with Japanese immigrant communities since the first Japanese immigrants arrived on US soil. Religious schools indoctrinated Japanese American children starting in day care services and exerting influence over a student's entire primary education. During World War II, religious organizations advocated for fairer treatment of Japanese Americans, while working to Americanize them through religious indoctrination. In some instances, religious teachers followed their parishes into the camps to continue their religious instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span>Religious identity among Japanese Americans prior to incarceration was often complicated. Some Japanese Americans identified as Christian superficially before entering the camps in response to sociocultural pressure. Others turned more fully to Christianity for other reasons, ranging from the desire to identify with the American majority to true philosophical and religious conversion. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>",

Some internees identified as Buddhist in name only, not through action or ritual, while others were more devout in their practice. Even for less religious Japanese Americans in the camps, Buddhist ideas influenced traditional Japanese culture. Some internees identified as Christian while interweaving Buddhist traditions into daily life. These multiple religious and cultural influences created a blended and diverse approach to  worship and heritage in the camps. Alongside Christian worship, Buddhist religious practices flourished.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some historians theorize that this period of harsh discrimination strengthened traditional beliefs and practices for Japanese Americans. In some of the camps, this trend was evidenced by a surge in interest in and practice of Buddhism. Renewed attention to Buddhism, as well as Japanese cultural rituals more broadly, was part of the way that internees resisted the full Americanization and loyalty pressures imposed on them in the camps. Resistance was manifest in traditional gardens and Shinto shrines found in areas of the camps. For some, creating these tranquil and reverent outdoor spaces was an extension of longstanding aesthetics that drew upon their shared cultural heritage. For others, it was an act of quiet rebellion.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>",
