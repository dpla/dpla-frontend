But in practice, there was great discrimination during the selection process and running of the CCC camps for African Americans. A few early CCC camps were somewhat integrated, but this soon changed as the national CCC administration established separate camps for African Americans. </span></p>\n<p><span>The limited inclusion of African Americans in the CCC was an injustice in the context of a broad climate of discrimination and crisis for black Americans, who desperately needed work relief programs. In the early 1930s, unemployment for African Americans was soaring, and the people who were unemployed were already existing in conditions of extreme poverty. During the height of the Great Depression, while twenty-five percent of white men were unemployed, African American unemployment reached fifty percent.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Native Americans were also given a limited opportunity to participate in special CCC programs developed in collaboration with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Native American CCC enrollees often focused on much-needed infrastructure and improvements on reservations. Out of the over three million men who participated in the CCC program for much needed work relief, only 200,000 African American and 80,000 Native American men were able to enroll.</span></span></p>",

Twenty-five dollars a month was sent home to help their families and they were allowed to keep the rest for their own spending. The additional support sent home to the families of the CCC meant that the economic impact of the relief work was dispersed across the country. While the camps were originally set to house younger men, the government raised age limits in order to raise enrollment. Camp leaders were able to earn an extra fifteen dollars per month and assistant leaders earned an extra six dollars per month. Unemployed World War I veterans were also able to enlist in separate camps where there were fewer restrictions.</p>\n<p>The majority of the CCC enrollees were young, white men. Some integrated camps allowed African Americans to enroll in the program, but as the CCC progressed, it developed a small number of segregated camps for African Americans. Native Americans also participated in a separate program in the CCC’s “Indian Division.”</p>",

Because they were unable to grow and harvest crops, farming families were forced to leave their homes, only to find few job prospects during the Great Depression. The severe economic and environmental consequences of erosion made the need for conservation in the 1930s even more important.</span></p>\n<p><span>Franklin Roosevelt previously worked on reforestation programs on a small scale at his family’s estate in Hyde Park, New York and as governor of New York. In this role, he supported reforestation and giving unemployed men temporary jobs to plant trees and work on conservation programs for the state. When Roosevelt accepted the Democratic nomination for president, he proclaimed: “We know that a very hopeful and immediate means of relief, both for the unemployed and for agriculture, will come from a wide plan of the converting of many millions of acres of marginal and unused land into timber land through reforestation.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Similar programs using unemployed men for work planting trees and other conservation projects took place in other states in the early 1930s. In the spring of 1933, Roosevelt requested that the Departments of War, the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor join forces to develop a plan for unemployment relief through the creation of a civilian conservation corps, which would work on conservation projects. This initiative would coordinate programs on a national level that had previously operated within individual states.</span></p>",

The improved economy in the late 30s also led to increased desertion among the CCC men. There were also isolated incidents of revolts or refusal to work in a small number of camps. The sudden death of the director of the CCC Robert Fechner in 1939 also contributed to administrative difficulties within the program. </span></p>\n<p><span>The military involvement with the CCC had occasionally been a source of tension between those who viewed the program solely as a work relief program and those who saw opportunities for recruitment of young men for the military. In response to the war in Europe, in the early 1940s the CCC camps were also doing basic military drills in addition to their regular work.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>The Army benefited greatly with practices of logistics, transportation, and discipline through managing the CCC. The men of the CCC who enlisted in World War II were already used to military discipline and having to live and work alongside a variety of other men. CCC camps helped with logistical support on military bases in the early 1940s. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the CCC camps that were not contributing to the military effort were closed. Funding for the program was eliminated in 1942.</span></span></span></span></p>",

The US Forest Service employed skilled woodsmen alongside the camp enrollees to assist with forestry programs. This had the benefit of providing essential guidance to young men who had not been out in nature for an extended time before, in addition to providing employment to local workers from the surrounding region.</p>\n<p>The CCC also worked on nature conservation and wildlife protection programs. Leo Young worked with the Civilian Conservation Corps on the Bear River Bird Refuge, and commented in a 1972 oral history: “They’ve done a lot of good on the refuge. They hauled rock and the initial graveling of the dikes was done by the CCC boys. They hauled gravel on the dikes and smoothed the beaches. They also helped in gathering sick ducks, fencing, nesting surveys, and projects like that.”</p>\n<p>One example of pest control as a conservation activity was the Mormon Cricket Project on Blue Mountain. The CCC built trenches to trap and exterminate Mormon crickets, flightless insects that can cause damage to crops and rangeland if they break out in large swarms.</p>\n<p>Some of the programs that the CCC developed look counterproductive when compared against current environmental knowledge. Swamps were drained as part of mosquito control projects, which had negative effects on the wildlife of many areas. Soil erosion in the southern states was fought by planting the invasive plant kudzu as ground cover. Kudzu is popularly known as the “vine that ate the south.”</p>",

Robert Fechner, a union man who had previously served as a labor advisor to Roosevelt, was selected to direct the CCC. An administrative council for the CCC was created with delegates appointed by the Secretaries of War, Labor, Interior, and Agriculture. The Army dealt with logistics such as transportation and administration of the camps for the young men, including dealing with discipline issues. Men who enrolled agreed to work for six months. Administrative work for the CCC at the federal level involved frequent disagreements between departments, for example between the Forest Service and the Army.</p>\n<p>Criticism of the new program came from a variety of organizations. Representatives of the labor movement were concerned about the low wages for the CCC men.

Movies were also shown occasionally for entertainment. Journalism was a popular activity for the men, with many camps producing their own newsletters.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>CCC men could also walk to the nearest town to take part in activities there. Lights out in the camps was at 10:00 p.m. and the men rose at 6:00 a.m. to begin their day.

They were allowed to take part in educational programs after their work was done for the day. While some attempts were made to formalize the educational opportunities for the men, a full-scale comprehensive education program was never implemented. Some of the administrators involved with the CCC saw it as a work relief program only and education programs as a potential distraction from work.</p>\n<p>There were CCC instructors appointed to oversee education with assistance from one enrollee in each camp. In addition to the camp instructors, enrollees volunteered their expertise in teaching courses. Local community members also served as instructors. The CCC engaged in vocational training, helping men develop skills such as welding, surveying, building, carpentry, and driving.</p>\n<p>The CCC was also effective at providing reading education to men who previously were illiterate. Over 57,000 men in the camps learned to read. Many men who had interrupted their education to go to work were able to leave the CCC with a high school diploma, and some were also able to obtain college degrees. Given the limited amount of time allocated to education in the CCC camps, it is impressive that so many enrollees were able to further their education.</p>",

They fought forest fires, helped out in blizzards, and provided assistance with flood control. They also worked on disaster prevention measures. The trails, lookout towers, firebreaks, and roads that the CCC built made previously inaccessible forest areas more easily defended from fires. At the same time, removing underbrush and cleaning up potentially flammable materials in forests also decreased the prevalence of small fires that are actually beneficial to a forest’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One notable rescue was the case of the Prettyman party, where CCC men from Boulder City came to the rescue of a small group who were trapped by snow near the Nevada-Maryland mine, close to Rachel, Nevada. The CCC also were key in helping people in Indiana during the Ohio River flood of 1937. The CCC helped save sheep herds in Utah during blizzards in 1936 and 1937.</p>",

In 1935, the National Park Service oversaw the activities of 600 CCC camps that worked on developing both state and national parks. Small dams created lakes near campgrounds. The CCC built picnic areas, fireplaces, new park entrance stations, and new roads and trails that made the national parks more accessible.</span></p>\n<p><span>The CCC men also built many basic tourist cabins as well as ranger stations and signage for the parks. In addition to developing the infrastructure for the parks, CCC park support activities also included cultivating plant nurseries and seed collection for revegetation. Hiking trails that are still in use today were originally cut by CCC men, including extensive work cutting granite blocks and laying trails in Acadia National Park in Maine.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The CCC completed the Colorado River trail in the Grand Canyon, along with many other structural improvements that are still in use today. These are just a few examples of the extensive work done in the national and state park system by the men of the CCC.</span></span></p>",

Prior to the water-related projects undertaken by the CCC, there were fewer recreational facilities created by Bureau of Reclamation projects. Many of the same structures built to encourage tourism in parks, like picnic tables, stoves, boating facilities, and hiking areas near reservoirs and lakes, encouraged recreation in these areas.</p>",

The NAACP monitored and protested systemic CCC discrimination against African Americans. Generally the CCC director Fechner supported strict segregation, and, when faced with African American enrollment issues, decided to restrict African American enrollees in response. While the camps set in southern states were segregated, some northern camps incorporated black men, although they were seldom able to obtain the higher paying supervisory jobs of white men.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Despite segregation and exclusion, nearly all of the African American men who were selected took part in the additional educational opportunities provided to them by the program, gaining skills and job training in addition to the economic benefits associated with the work.</span></span></p>",

There were 4,500 camps that provided work relief to over three million men. They completed the Appalachian Trail and created many national parks in the eastern United States. Existing national parks were improved with new roads and structures for visitors. The CCC brought alpine skiing to the United States when they cut the first trails on Mount Mansfield, in what would become Stowe Mountain Resort. The CCC also built Red Rocks in Colorado for performances.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The success of the CCC has inspired other youth work programs centered on conservation, ranging from national non-profits to state-based programs. The National Park System and state park systems would not have been able to expand without the dedicated work of the CCC. Many CCC enrollees held reunions to commemorate their time in the CCC. Visitors to national and state parks today are still able to see many of the structures and improvements that the CCC men built through their efforts.</span></span></p>",
