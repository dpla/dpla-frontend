The public was able to experience the Apollo 8 mission with the crew via live television coverage, and on Christmas Eve the crew’s legendary Genesis reading was broadcast over radio transmission to everyone listening back home. </p>\n<p>Apollo 8 achieved many firsts, including the first manned mission in the Saturn V spacecraft, sending men around the Moon and returning them safely to Earth. NASA took a risk sending the astronauts to orbit the Moon, knowing that transmission would be lost once the spacecraft was directly behind it. Without direction from the NASA command center, the crew successfully burned the engines at the exact position needed to curve the spacecraft around the Moon’s back and return home. The United States was getting closer to conquering the Moon.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1916,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">A view of the 363-foot high Saturn V launch vehicle that carried Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders into space.

Aboard Friendship 7 in 1962, John Glenn consumed applesauce in a tube and sugar tablets with water, making him the first American to ingest food in space.

Pouches, or wet packs, were also introduced, letting astronauts enjoy beef sandwiches and chocolate pudding without rehydration.

There were limitations on weight and storage, a lack of refrigeration, and considerations had to be made to keep food from floating away.</span></p>\n<p>It was unclear if normal digestion occurred when in outer space. Aboard Friendship 7 in 1962, John Glenn consumed applesauce in a tube and sugar tablets with water, making him the first American to ingest food in space. The space food developed by NASA next was generally unappetizing, consisting of puréed food sucked through a straw or small cubes of dehydrated food. Crumbs posed potential problems as they could become lodged in instrumentation or even an astronaut’s nostril.</p>\n<p><span><span>With the Gemini missions, during the early to mid 1960s, came freeze-dried food that was easily rehydrated by injecting water into the package. By the Apollo missions of the late 1960s to early 1970s, astronauts could use utensils, which were attached to trays with magnets or Velcro to keep them from floating away. Pouches, or wet packs, were also introduced, letting astronauts enjoy beef sandwiches and chocolate pudding without rehydration. The wetness of the food allowed it to remain on the spoon instead of floating away.

The teams at NASA, including crewmembers and mathematicians, were invaluable assets and played a major role in the success of the space programs.</span></p>\n<p>Each spacecraft required mission crews, helping guide the flight back on Earth. While they never left the planet, these crewmembers made it possible for early spacecraft to, among other operations, procure photographs of space and function safely during flight. A notable member of the mission crew for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions was Guenter Wendt, the pad leader who oversaw flight safety. Wendt was primarily responsible for spacecraft tests, checkouts, and launch operations—he was the mission crewmember that saw the astronauts off before liftoff.</p>\n<p>During the space programs, a significant number of women worked in professional positions at NASA. Referred to as “human computers,” they performed mathematical equations and calculations by hand. “Have the girl run the numbers,” John Glenn requested from space. These women did more than just computations and reciting numbers, though. Many, like Sharon Stack and Katherine Johnson, were professionals who published scholarly articles during a time when it was very rare for women to do so.

While they never left the planet, these crewmembers made it possible for early spacecraft to, among other operations, procure photographs of space and function safely during flight. A notable member of the mission crew for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions was Guenter Wendt, the pad leader who oversaw flight safety. Wendt was primarily responsible for spacecraft tests, checkouts, and launch operations—he was the mission crewmember that saw the astronauts off before liftoff.</p>\n<p>During the space programs, a significant number of women worked in professional positions at NASA. Referred to as “human computers,” they performed mathematical equations and calculations by hand. “Have the girl run the numbers,” John Glenn requested from space. These women did more than just computations and reciting numbers, though. Many, like Sharon Stack and Katherine Johnson, were professionals who published scholarly articles during a time when it was very rare for women to do so.

Before their husbands flew aboard the first Mercury missions in the 1960s, Gordon Cooper’s wife was a licensed pilot and Gus Grissom’s wife worked full time to pay for Gus’ education. Commonly referred to as Togethersville, Clear Lake City, Texas, was where early astronauts resided and their wives created a support system.</span></p>\n<p><span>Besides being married to astronauts, these women had something in common—they were expected to personify a hero's wife and provide support for their husband's involvement in space missions. It was a heightened experience to what many stay-at-home women in the 1950s and 1960s experienced, coupled with intense media scrutiny. The Mercury astronauts and their wives, for example, signed a lucrative deal with </span><em>Life </em><span>magazine, giving it access to the families’ private lives and homes while their husbands were both at home and in space. Inside the magazine’s pages were full color photos of their families’ vacations and their husbands on the living room couch. They shared their hopes and their fears with reporters, and even penned columns themselves. However, the publicity took its toll. There were thirty married astronauts during the Gemini and Apollo programs—all but seven marriages ended in divorce.</span></p>\n<p>Love wasn’t always lost, however. After returning to Earth, John Glenn would switch his briefcase from one hand to the other in view of cameras as a way of telling his wife that he loved her. Some astronauts even named parts of the Moon after their wives, such as Mount Marilyn, after Jim Lovell's wife.</p>\n<p><span><span>These moments helped husbands acknowledge the sacrifices their wives and families made in order for them to pursue such a risky and consuming career. As Trudy Cooper, Gordon Cooper’s wife, wrote in </span><em><span>Life</span></em><span>: “I suppose many women would become impatient with a life that is as uncertain and full of change as ours. I never know when Gordon is going to have to leave and often I don’t know when he is returning until he gets home. But changes, delays, and disrupted schedules are so typical of service life that you just learn to accept them.

Before their husbands flew aboard the first Mercury missions in the 1960s, Gordon Cooper’s wife was a licensed pilot and Gus Grissom’s wife worked full time to pay for Gus’ education. Commonly referred to as Togethersville, Clear Lake City, Texas, was where early astronauts resided and their wives created a support system.</span></p>\n<p><span>Besides being married to astronauts, these women had something in common—they were expected to personify a hero's wife and provide support for their husband's involvement in space missions. It was a heightened experience to what many stay-at-home women in the 1950s and 1960s experienced, coupled with intense media scrutiny. The Mercury astronauts and their wives, for example, signed a lucrative deal with </span><em>Life </em><span>magazine, giving it access to the families’ private lives and homes while their husbands were both at home and in space. Inside the magazine’s pages were full color photos of their families’ vacations and their husbands on the living room couch. They shared their hopes and their fears with reporters, and even penned columns themselves. However, the publicity took its toll. There were thirty married astronauts during the Gemini and Apollo programs—all but seven marriages ended in divorce.</span></p>\n<p>Love wasn’t always lost, however. After returning to Earth, John Glenn would switch his briefcase from one hand to the other in view of cameras as a way of telling his wife that he loved her. Some astronauts even named parts of the Moon after their wives, such as Mount Marilyn, after Jim Lovell's wife.</p>\n<p><span><span>These moments helped husbands acknowledge the sacrifices their wives and families made in order for them to pursue such a risky and consuming career. As Trudy Cooper, Gordon Cooper’s wife, wrote in </span><em><span>Life</span></em><span>: “I suppose many women would become impatient with a life that is as uncertain and full of change as ours. I never know when Gordon is going to have to leave and often I don’t know when he is returning until he gets home. But changes, delays, and disrupted schedules are so typical of service life that you just learn to accept them. You learn to take the things your husband does in stride, too.” </span></span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":1962,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">The wives of the Apollo 11 astronauts at a press conference at the U.S. Embassy in London, October 1969. <span>Copyright Leslie Priest/Associated Press.</span></p>","item":{"id":813935,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/813935"}},{"id":1962,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">The wives of the Apollo 11 astronauts at a press conference at the U.S. Embassy in London, October 1969. <span>Copyright Leslie Priest/Associated Press.</span></p>","item":{"id":813935,"resource":"items","url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/813935"},"files":[{"id":3009,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/files/3009","file_urls":{"original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/351f13f85a51ede7826cee712f52075a.jpeg","fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/351f13f85a51ede7826cee712f52075a.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/351f13f85a51ede7826cee712f52075a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/351f13f85a51ede7826cee712f52075a.jpg"},"added":"2015-09-16T15:53:37+00:00","modified":"2021-10-11T13:34:10+00:00","filename":"351f13f85a51ede7826cee712f52075a.jpeg","authentication":"e76e399ecfbcb9537cc19e23cd70c575","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"8ee94146-0bec-4230-803e-72a259964318-2060x1236.jpeg","size":929594,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1}},"item":{"id":813935,"url":"http://omeka.internal.dp.la/api/items/813935","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}]},{"id":1963,"page_id":711,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[{"id":1963,"caption":"<p>Apollo 11 astronauts and their wives are welcomed to the Royal Palace in Brussels, Belgium.
