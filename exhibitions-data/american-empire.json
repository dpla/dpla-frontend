From the annexation of Texas in 1845 to the Mexican American War of 1846 to 1848, the US aggressively pursued new lands in the name of national interests. America's reign as an imperial force, however, did not begin until 1898 with the Spanish-American War. What began as a mission to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule</span><span>—</span><span>and in the process, rid the US of the threat of European invasion</span><span>—</span><span>grew into an international war that left the victorious US bigger and richer than when it had started.</span></p>\n<p><span>This section examines how the age of imperialism began in America as political and economic agendas underpinned campaigns to defend the US. These are the stories of what, as one newspaper reported, \"put the taste of Empire in the mouth of the people.\"</span></p>",

Most sugar society elites were the descendants of missionaries and farmers who arrived decades earlier. Following annexation, Puerto Rico was similarly transformed into a hub for sugar and coffee farms with elite planters dictating the island's policies with the US. Trade also favored the mainland. High tariffs supported American businesses exporting manufactured items to the Pacific and Caribbean and kept industries in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines at a competitive disadvantage. With these economic systems in place, the colonies could not be seen as American.

At the same time, the aftermath of World War II reignited campaigns for independence across colonies. This section follows how Hawaii, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico renegotiated their relationships with the US. From the Pacific to the Caribbean, the legacies of America's empire continued to shape foreign and domestic policy and popular culture.</span></p>\n<p><span>For Hawaii, the American flag stayed in place. In August 1959, President Eisenhower officially declared Hawaii the fiftieth state. This followed months of debate both on the islands and in the mainland. To determine its fate, the Hawaiian government polled residents in 1950 and </span><span>1959,</span><span> and they overwhelmingly approved both a state constitution and the larger statehood bill. Territorial representative John Burns embarked on an ambitious campaign through Washington DC to </span><span>rally support for Hawaiian statehood.</span><span> Meanwhile in Congress, the statehood bill became involved with other national issues. Southern Democrats, as an example, opposed Hawaii because they thought the admission would tip the civil rights debate against them. Nevertheless, Hawaii was added to the union and </span><span>earned </span><span>a star on the flag. In 1993, President Bill Clinton issued an official apology for the US's involvement in overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy.</span></p>",

          "text": "<p><span>The United States is no stranger to strange lands. From its founding as a British colony to its settlement of the West, America is rooted in a tradition of exploration, conquest, and opportunism. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries marked a new era in American expansion. A growing US economy was hungry for more resources and new markets. Politicians pressured the government to protect and promote American interests worldwide. </span><span>An expanding population</span><span> was redefining American society. Each of these factors contributed to the age of American imperialism</span><span>—</span><span>an era of unprecedented territorial and </span><span>political growth and cultural development.</span><span> Following the Spanish-American War of 1898, the US emerged as a formidable world power with territories across the Pacific and Caribbean. Of course, these new borders came with growing pains. As US imperialists insisted that the country had a responsibility to civilize \"inferior\" peoples, opponents lobbied on behalf of the colonies, insisting that imperialism contradicted the nation's founding principles of sovereignty, equality, and democracy.</span></p>\n<p><span>This exhibition explores the origins, development, and eventual fall of the American empire. An empire is more than a story of geographic borders and international politics; it is also rooted in forces of national pride, popular culture, and indigenous communities. Moving through the colonial settlements of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, these stories investigate the lives and legacies of citizens and subjects</span><span>—</span><span>those who established and defined the American presence abroad; those who fought to keep the American flag off their soil; those who crafted domestic visions of exotic lands; and those who negotiated life in the empire. This exhibition maps the diverse and rocky terrain of the American empire to show how it informs contemporary conversations on heritage, citizenship, racism, and globalization.</span></p>",

Nevertheless, these individuals navigated courses across the Pacific and Caribbean in search of agency and opportunity. The stories featured here are exceptional, representing the lives of the privileged few. Taken together, however, they reveal how native peoples fashioned themselves as American citizens. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>",

          "text": "<p>The late nineteenth century was a time of crisis and confidence in the US. A financial panic left industries in search of new markets to sell their goods, particularly in Asia and Latin America. Meanwhile, as immigration rates to the US soared, a wave of nationalism inspired citizens to define what it meant to be an American. For example, the 1890s saw the creation of patriotic traditions like the Pledge of Allegiance. Others thought more strategically. Captain Alfred Mahan Thayer published <em>The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, </em>which argued for the US to invest in its navy and take control of international waters.</p>\n<p>On February 15, 1898, the <em>USS Maine</em>, an American naval ship, exploded in Havana, Cuba leaving 262 American soldiers dead. Although an official investigation named no perpetrator, newspapers quickly blamed Spain. The \"yellow press,\" sensational journalism that relied more on fabrication than fact, transformed the <em>USS Maine</em> into a national spectacle as reporters circulated dramatic accounts of the explosion and made allegations about Spain's involvement in the attack. \"Remember the Maine!\" became an inescapable cry. Americans demanded retribution.</p>\n<p>Vengeful public sentiment mixed with economic interests and rising nationalism compelled the US to take action against Spain. As one man recalled, \"Whenever the battleship Maine is mentioned, my memory leaps...to the excitement aroused by the word 'war.'\"  </p>",

Initially the US stood firm in its commitment to independence. Congress went so far as to add the Teller Amendment to the war declaration to prohibit the annexation of Cuba. Peace negotiations, however, revealed the US's more opportunistic, more </span><span>imperialistic</span><span> agenda. The Treaty of Paris granted independence to </span><span>Cuba and forced Spain</span><span> to cede Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines to the US.</span></p>\n<p><span>The war also established the policies and players of America’s growing empire. Most notably Theodore Roosevelt became a national hero. Memoirs, silent films, and traveling shows celebrated how he and his Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry regiment, fought through Cuba. Roosevelt channeled this celebrity and bravado into his political career. As president, he \"walked softly and carried a big stick,\" aggressively defending American territory and policy. He assured critics: \"so long as a nation shows that it knows how to act with decency… it need fear no interference from the United States.\" Still, he and his supporters pressed on to make the \"United States the dominant power on the shores of the Pacific Ocean.\"</span></p>\n<p><span>The age of imperialism had begun.</span></p>",

Despite the defeat of Filipino patriots and continued challenges from scattered rebel groups, the Philippines enjoyed a measure of self-rule under the US. In 1912, President Woodrow Wilson replaced the Philippine Commission, largely staffed by presidential appointments, with the democratically elected Philippine Senate. By 1935, the US recognized the formation of the Philippine Commonwealth, headed by President Manuel L. Quezon. Both Manila and Washington, DC imagined the commonwealth as the organization that would help the archipelago transition from American territory to sovereign nation.</span></p>\n<p><span>All negotiations ended with World War II.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1942 and occupied the islands through 1945. President Franklin Roosevelt's initial reluctance to send troops to the islands was controversial, but the Philippines ultimately played a key role in America's Pacific campaign. </span><span>With the war’s end</span><span> came liberation. In 1946, US officials returned to the Philippines and ratified the Treaty of Manila. This granted full independence to the Philippines, as well as guaranteed war reparations and trade concessions. Manuel Roxas was elected the first president. On July 4, 1946, crowds gathered in the streets of Manila to celebrate. The republic was now free from Spain and the US. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>",

With the help of Christian missionaries and sugarcane planters, Americans settled in Hawaii forming a robust, wealthy—and largely white—class who lobbied for the US. Their ambitions came to a head in 1887 with the Bayonet Constitution. Issued by a coalition of American and European industrialists and Hawaiian elite, the document aimed to dismantle the Hawaiian monarchy by transferring legislative and executive power to the US and stripping native Hawaiians and Asian immigrants of their citizenship rights. President Grover Cleveland rejected the document stating that it constituted nothing less than an \"armed invasion... committed...without the authority of Congress.\"</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Native Hawaiians fought back by drafting their own document to \"maintain...the independent autonomy of the islands of Hawaii…[and] secure...the continuance of their civil rights.\" Queen Liliuokalani, sister to King Kalakaua, also moved to restore power to the monarchy and native Hawaiians, but she was eventually deposed in 1893 during a coup d'etat organized by the US. Increasing interests in Pacific trade and industry, coupled with the strategic advantage Hawaii provided during the Spanish-American War, compelled President McKinley to </span><span>formally annex the islands in July 1898.</span><span> In August, the US celebrated the transfer of power with a ceremonial flag raising over Iolani Palace in Honolulu. </span></span></p>",

In 1896, Filipino nationalists, largely organized by the militant </span><em>Katipunan </em><span>group, waged an armed rebellion against Spain. Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of a </span><em>Katipunan </em><span>faction, emerged as prominent military and political leader. The resistance even established the First Republic of the Philippines with Aguinaldo at its head. Neither Spain nor the US recognized its legitimacy. Nonetheless, during the Spanish-American War, Filipinos fought alongside the US hoping that an American alliance and victory would mean independence. Allies, however, soon became enemies.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the Treaty of Paris, the US agreed to annex the Philippines at the cost of $20 million. Angered by the betrayal, Filipinos declared war. The Philippine-American War was a bloodier and more brutal affair than its predecessor. Where the US won in manpower and technology, Filipino rebels made up for their military deficit with tenacious guerrilla tactics. Philippine General Elwell S. Otis promised to \"drive the Americans into the sea.\" By 1902 the US had captured Aguinaldo and devastated a majority of Filipino cities and communities. The war came to </span><span>an end, and President</span><span> Theodore Roosevelt pardoned the insurgents. The Philippines was now officially a US territory.  </span></p>",

Just as intrepid Americans travelled across the territories in search of new adventures, natives and long-time residents began moving to the mainland.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hawaii was an especially popular hub for in-migration during American imperialism. The islands had a distinct and diverse population, thanks in large part to the sugar industry. Demand for the sweetener skyrocketed during the Civil War, prompting plantation owners to actively recruit laborers from Asia. When the US annexed the islands in 1898, it bestowed national status to native Hawaiians, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese. Many moved West. For Chinese workers, this was especially beneficial, as the Chinese Exclusion Act passed a few years prior in 1882 barred Chinese immigrants from outside the US. Hawaiian-born, or at the very least naturalized, Chinese could negotiate entry. Puerto Rico similarly provided a new channel to the US from the Caribbean. In 1910, less than 2,000 Puerto Ricans lived on the mainland; by the 1930s, more than 40,000 Puerto Ricans had migrated, </span><span>and most lived in New York City.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Imperial borders provided a new, if not heavily regulated, space for peoples across the Pacific and Caribbean to imagine and pursue new lives as Americans. </span></span></p>",

In Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, students gathered, and the relationships between them and their teachers mirrored the power dynamics between the colonized and colonizer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Following the annexation of Puerto Rico, the US reopened the island's schools with American educators. The US also prioritized public education in the Philippines. Government policy allocated nearly half of its annual budget to schooling, and official legislatures dictated curricula. Teachers taught almost exclusively in English, and they modeled their problem sets, student exercises, and class rules after American traditions. William B. Freer taught in the Philippines from 1901 to 1904. A native of Akron, Ohio, he worked under a contract with the US government and instructed classrooms in villages on the island of Luzon. He documented this work with writings and photographs that he later published as a memoir. Reflecting on his time overseas, Freer framed education as a colonial endeavor. He helped mold students into good subjects, familiar with and loyal to the US. Freer himself concluded: \"In such absence of enlightened sentiment...what genuine well-wisher of the Filipinos will desire to allow them… their independence...to place the responsibility of the ignorant many in the hands of the educated few?\"</span></p>",

William Jennings Bryan became one of the movement's most prominent leaders and ran for president on an anti-imperialist platform in 1900. Bryan lost the election, but the anti-imperialist movement carried on. It was a broad coalition uniting citizens across race, class, gender, and political party lines. While these groups worked to a common goal—an end to aggressive American expansion—their motivations often varied.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Some anti-imperialists supported segregation in addition to self-determination. They argued that the US should remain within its borders to avoid the mixing of white and nonwhite peoples. Others perceived empire as a direct contradiction to the nation's democratic commitments. Writing on the Philippine Islands, one man commented: \"If the Declaration of Independence be true…[Filipinos] are to decide for themselves...otherwise there is no freedom.\" African American anti-imperialists like W. E. B. Du Bois found disturbing similarities between the racist Jim Crow policies of the American South and colonial oppressions dictating the lives of native Hawaiians, Filipinos, and Puerto Ricans. The anti-imperialist movement was but another front for Black activists to combat racism. </span></span></p>",

A decorating manual from 1913 associated women with the homes they kept. It claimed: \"We are sure to judge a woman...by her surroundings. We judge her temperament, her habits, her inclinations, by the interior of her home.\" Elite women staged the world in their homes. Wallpapers depicted scenes from the Philippines so that families could peer into the Pacific from the comfort of their drawing room. The pineapple became a symbol for wealth and charm; only the most gracious (and incidentally, wealthiest) hosts welcomed guests with Hawaii's trademark fruit. Meanwhile, Americans overseas held tight to traditional fashion and design from home. In the Philippines, for example, </span><span>westernized spaces provided familiar comforts in new lands, as well as a model of civility for native peoples.</span></p>\n<p><span>US obsession with imperial imagery was controversial. The trend was based almost entirely on orientalist stereotypes—how the West chose to imagine the East. The thought of women as imperial homemakers also perpetuated the thought that a women's </span><span>only</span><span> place was in the home. For all its imagination, American popular culture ultimately kept the reality of empire, its lands, peoples, and politics, at bay.</span></p>",
