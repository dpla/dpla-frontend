Through a provision of the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act, a mortgage program provided for returning soldiers in 1944. People were eager to buy homes and settle down, away from crowded cities that afforded little space for their children to play. Enterprising developers went to work building spaces that could specifically accommodate families.</span></p>\n<p><span>Dr. Spock’s bestselling book on parenting, </span><em>The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</em><span>, implored parents towards a more empathetic style of parenting, through which children’s needs were listened to and understood. Rigid schedules and firm rules for children were slowly discarded, and children occupied a more empowered position in postwar families. The suburban homes that many families lived in reflected this, with designated playrooms and spacious yards.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the safe parks and new schools that so attracted families were not enjoyed by all in the postwar period.

A neighboring farm might be hours away, and play time was limited anyway because of work and chores. Many youths answered the call of newly industrialized cities, where they moved to work once they came of age. Recognizing a need among rural children for social organizations that also instilled an appreciation for rural life, agricultural clubs were born. Established as a national organization known as 4-H in 1914, these clubs operated in several states, and sought to create a youth movement in agriculture. In particular, 4-H hoped to harness young people's willingness to experiment with new technology, which adult farmers had been hesitant to do. Camping was a major feature of the organization—a social benefit to farm children who may have otherwise been isolated from other children, especially in the summertime.</p>\n<p>The organization satisfied the concerns of Progressives because it fostered a relationship with nature within an organized and instructional setting—a feature of play advocated by the playground reformers. Furthermore, a child who joined 4-H was signing up to participate in activities that were strictly for fun: a luxury that many farm children, busy with chores, lacked. By the mid-twentieth century, 4-H clubs had sprung up in high schools around the country.</p>","id":1571,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2844,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/8aee97db41d94952f1bbb9ee706f1734.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/8aee97db41d94952f1bbb9ee706f1734.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/8aee97db41d94952f1bbb9ee706f1734.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/8aee97db41d94952f1bbb9ee706f1734.pdf"}}],"id":1571,"caption":"<p><span><span>Excerpt from<em> This is 4-H</em>, 1967. <span>Courtesy of the University of Virginia via HathiTrust.</span></span></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"This is 4-H","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"d36833280dda0cb833e8b0404b1243dc","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":812373}}]},{"text":null,"id":1572,"order":3,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2150,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/5f5909110794008a1b6e7f415d87c0bc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/5f5909110794008a1b6e7f415d87c0bc.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/5f5909110794008a1b6e7f415d87c0bc.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/5f5909110794008a1b6e7f415d87c0bc.jpg"}}],"id":1572,"caption":"<p><span><span>“Photograph of 4-H clubs event, Habersham County, Georgia, 1953.” Courtesy of the Clarkesville-Habersham Library via Digital Library of Georgia.</span></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Photograph of Habersham County 4-H clubs event","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"be958c0fccba5a0ea72be7b03d2f13e7","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":812340}}]}],"title":"Children's Organizations"},{"parent":null,"slug":"homepage","id":475,"order":0,"page_blocks":[{"text":"<p><span>In twenty-first century American society, childhood is popularly understood as a time of innocence, learning, and play.

Communicable diseases were caught and spread easily due to harsh living conditions, poor nutrition, and lack of sanitation. Cholera, typhus, polio, and tuberculosis were all prevalent.  A lack of health education in both rural and urban communities also contributed to the problem.</p>\n<p>Maternal and infant health was of great concern to public health workers. With a lack of health services and proper sanitation, pregnant mothers and infants of the working poor were at risk for disease and infection, especially in the summer because of dehydration.</p>\n<p>Early public health initiatives sought to prevent childhood disease, especially among the urban poor. Lillian Wald, a pioneer of public health, founded the Henry Street Settlement in 1893 in the immigrant-populated Lower East Side neighborhood of New York City. The organization provided much-needed health and social services for the neighborhood, including maternity and infant care. A strong advocate for child welfare, Wald helped to found the National Organization for Public Health Nursing and the Child Labor Committee, which later became the National Child Labor Committee.</p>","id":1563,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2152,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/158b8595df636b2509e3124b95855d0c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/158b8595df636b2509e3124b95855d0c.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/158b8595df636b2509e3124b95855d0c.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/158b8595df636b2509e3124b95855d0c.jpg"}}],"id":1563,"caption":"<p><span><span>“Photograph of a doctor taking a baby's pulse, Clarkesville, Georgia, 1953.” Courtesy of the Clarkesville-Habersham Library via Digital Library of Georgia.</span></span></p>","item":{"element_texts":[{"text":"Photograph of doctor taking a baby's pulse, Clarkesville, Georgia, 1953","element":{"name":"Title","id":50},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false},{"text":"9fa54d8697074d5e6b2ef6257ee4892f","element":{"name":"Has Version","id":68},"element_set":{"name":"Dublin Core","id":1},"html":false}],"id":812342}}]},{"text":null,"id":1564,"order":3,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2839,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/1a51704b560b2bd2eadbea6367a64f8d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/1a51704b560b2bd2eadbea6367a64f8d.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/1a51704b560b2bd2eadbea6367a64f8d.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/1a51704b560b2bd2eadbea6367a64f8d.pdf"}}],"id":1564,"caption":"<p>A report on health and sanitation in Clarkesville, Georgia, 1953.

But it was felt that city streets were unsuitable for children—they were hazardous to their physical as well as moral well-being.

Many camps opened in the 1920s for girls as well as boys. However, the children of farmers and the urban working-class were not the only ones who were thought to benefit from these camps. It was felt that the children of an emerging middle class were spending too much time indoors and losing the relationship to nature that their parents had. Summer camp offered children structured time in which to learn new skills, outdoor activities to foster a love of nature, and a chance to socialize with other children.</p>\n<p>Camps opened across the country, often near lakes. At camps such as Camp Kiwadinipi and Camp Ojiketa in Minnesota, girl campers would canoe, swim, fish, and hike. Girls were also encouraged to complete “gypsy trips,” on which they would trek through the wilderness without a route or destination, often for days.</p>","id":1612,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":2126,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/786a55225c9e636a9bd1e57bc2259548.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/786a55225c9e636a9bd1e57bc2259548.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/786a55225c9e636a9bd1e57bc2259548.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/786a55225c9e636a9bd1e57bc2259548.jpg"}}],"id":1612,"caption":"<p><span><span>Girls swimming at Camp Ojiketa on Green Lake, near Chisago City, Minnesota, 1931.
