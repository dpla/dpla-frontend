This included the use of cantilevered wings, which are anchored on just one end and still in use today. This type of wing reduces the weight of the plane, and increases speed and efficiency.

Although Quimby only flew for eleven months after receiving her license, she accomplished a lot during her time in the pilot’s seat. In addition to being the first woman to fly a plane at night, she also flew across the English Channel, and at the inauguration festivities for Mexico’s president-elect in 1911. She did it all wearing a custom-made purple satin flight suit—a visible symbol of her femininity in the male-dominated aviation world. Quimby planned to be the first woman to fly mail from Boston to New York, but died in a tragic accident while taking her plane for a test flight in July of 1912.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Shortly after Quimby received her pilot’s license, her friend Matilde Moisant became the second woman to obtain the certification from the Aero Club. Like Quimby, she learned to fly at the Moisant Aviation School, which was run by her brother. She quickly became a skilled pilot. By September 1911, she had won the Rodman-Wanamaker altitude trophy. Shortly thereafter, Moisant stopped flying at the request of her family (and possibly because of Quimby’s untimely death) after her aircraft burst into flames and she herself was set afire. Though not seriously injured in the accident, she retired from flying in 1912. </span></span></p>","id":842,"order":2,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1157,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/2bddaa2fe72de3b7ac072717ba025a45.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/2bddaa2fe72de3b7ac072717ba025a45.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/2bddaa2fe72de3b7ac072717ba025a45.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/2bddaa2fe72de3b7ac072717ba025a45.jpg"}}],"id":842,"caption":"<p>“Miss Harriet Quimby, Boston girl,” 1911. <span>Copyright Leslie Jones.

This was particularly true for women in the military. Despite the success of the WASP program, it wasn’t until 1976, more than thirty years after the end of WWII, that women could join the Air Force’s pilot training. Fighter pilot training would not open up to women until 1993. In 1974, Sally D. Woolfolk became the first female military pilot in the Army. That same year, Barbara Allen Rainey earned her wings, becoming the first woman pilot in the Navy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, women make up about 19 percent of the Air Force and hold jobs in almost all fields of service.

This was made possible by cheap surplus Curtiss JN-4 “Jenny” aircrafts—biplanes produced to train WWI pilots that were subsequently used by civilians post war. They were popularly used by pilots known as “barnstormers” who would wow people with stunts at air shows across the country. Barnstorming pilots also offered joyrides, which introduced riders to flying and brought the experience of aviation to rural areas.</span></p>\n<p><span>Record-breaking flights, speed races around pylons in stadiums, and long-distance races captured the public imagination. The 1929 Air Shows in Cleveland were attended by half a million people, excited by not just the stunts, but the possibility of seeing a crash. The ten-day spectacle included a grand parade kick-off and a three million dollar aviation exhibit, alongside blimp rides and parachuting demonstrations between races.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many of those record-breakers in the 1930s were women pilots, now central figures of barnstorming shows and races. The formerly all-male cross-country races opened up to female competitors in 1936. In that first co-ed cross-country race, aviatrixes Louise Thaden and Blanche Noyes clocked in with the best times.</span></p>\n<p><span>The popularity of these races and air shows spurred manufacturers to build even faster planes. There were also developments in navigation, formerly done only with maps and compasses. By the 1930s, pilots were aided by instruments based on gyroscopes or airspeed that calculated altitude, velocity, and heading.</span></p>\n<p><span>Emergency landings were still a possibility that pilots had to plan for—they couldn't even count on making it to a runway. In some cases, a clearing had to do. When flying solo or just with a co-pilot, they needed to understand how their planes worked in case there weren't mechanics to address problems where they landed.</span></p>","id":837,"order":1,"attachments":[{"files":[{"id":1153,"file_urls":{"fullsize":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/fullsize/76970fb3020b8cd29a4bb5d1d4d95c84.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/square_thumbnails/76970fb3020b8cd29a4bb5d1d4d95c84.jpg","thumbnail":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/thumbnails/76970fb3020b8cd29a4bb5d1d4d95c84.jpg","original":"https://dp.la/api/exhibits/files/original/76970fb3020b8cd29a4bb5d1d4d95c84.jpeg"}}],"id":837,"caption":"<p><span>A Curtiss training plane.

Most early female aviation milestones were attained by members of the Ninety-Nines and the organization continues today. Earhart herself served as president in 1931.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to her advocacy work, Earhart made daring flights and captured the world’s attention.

That same year she also became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent.</span></p>\n<p><span>Her most ambitious record attempt, to fly around the world, was also her last.

In total, WASPs, representing 78 bases across the nation, delivered 12,650 aircraft. Many more tested rocket-propelled planes, piloted jet-propelled planes, and worked with radar-controlled targets before the program was disbanded in December 1944.
