He helped create separate Catholic churches for Greeks, Syrians, Portuguese, and Lithuanians.</p>\n<p>He was decidedly against the strike and was very wary of radical political and labor agitation. His patriotism was unbounded as he frequently hosted patriotic displays. His most famous act related to the strike was his organizing of the \"God and Country\" parade in May 1912. The parade was in direct response to the radical and atheistic tendencies of the IWW. who at the end of the strike held a victory parade included in which was a banner that read \"No God, No Master.\" This enraged Father O'Reilly and led him to organize the parade involving over 100,000 people that would leave an indelible mark on the remembrance of the 1912 strike and labor militancy in Lawrence.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"id":46,"caption":"<p class=\"title\">Portrait of Father James T.

It occurred when a shot was fired into a crowd of scuffling strikers and police. A bystander, LoPizzo was struck in the chest by a bullet and died. Strikers claimed the shot came from police; police accused the strikers. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">By order of Governor Foss (also a mill owner), an additional twelve companies of infantry and two troops of cavalry were brought in to Lawrence to enforce order after Lopizzo's death. Parades, open air meetings, and gatherings of three or more were forbidden. Tensions were high, militia were on the streets. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">On January 30, a large group, including Lebanese musicians, gathered to accompany the strikers, who often sang as part of their demonstrations. The Lebanese band members that day included John Ramey, 20, a coronet player.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">In no time, a militia detachment approached the banned rally, exchanges were made, and the militia processed in a charge-bayonet position.  As Ramey retreated he was struck in the back by a bayonet.
