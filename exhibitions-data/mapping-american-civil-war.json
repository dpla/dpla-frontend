What images linger?

Visual images comprise an important part of this narrative. As technology improved during the second half of the nineteenth</span><span> century, the ability to create and disseminate memorable images expanded greatly. What the viewer understood or remembered varied, but the presence of a common visual experience was part of the formation of a collective culture with a shared sensibility.</span></p>\n<p>Yet different memories of the same events persist, leading to conflicting interpretations of the past.  What is consistent is the need to remember, and to find some way to honor and thank those who, as Lincoln proclaimed, sacrificed their lives \"to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\"</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":760,"caption":"<p>\"[Panoramic View of the Gettysburg Battlefield],\" ca. 1866. Courtesy of the Norman B.

today’s perspective, many regard Vietnam as the first \"living room\" war, with evening television programs bringing the latest news to kitchen tables and living rooms across America. But the Civil War was really the first. Just as we go online or watch CNN for immediate updates on the current conflict, those on the Civil War home front looked to daily newspapers and weekly magazines for current news on the war. Advances in communications, transportation, and technology enabled information to be spread more rapidly than ever before.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>The press told this story with words and images by publishing cartoons, photographs and sketches.

Civil War was unlike any other in United States history. Fought completely on American soil, armies were most successful when they had accurate knowledge of the terrain. The South had an early advantage, not only because their troops had superior military leaders, but because most of the battles occurred on their home territory. Thus, they needed to wage a defensive campaign only. Reliable cartographic information was limited or absent and severely hindered northern efforts, often resulting in high casualties.</span></p>\n<p>The war was all encompassing and every American had a personal stake in its course. Soldiers were recruited, supplied, trained, and transported. Casualties were high and many civilians helped care for the wounded. Those on the home front raised money, provided comfort and longed for news of their loved ones. Visual images such as maps, photographs, cartoons and prints told the story as it unfolded. Traditional means such as letters, diaries and sketches also provided detailed accounts of the conflict.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":738,"caption":"<p>\"Historical sketch of the rebellion,\" 1962.

Civil War was unlike any other in United States history. Fought completely on American soil, armies were most successful when they had accurate knowledge of the terrain. The South had an early advantage, not only because their troops had superior military leaders, but because most of the battles occurred on their home territory. Thus, they needed to wage a defensive campaign only. Reliable cartographic information was limited or absent and severely hindered northern efforts, often resulting in high casualties.</span></p>\n<p>The war was all encompassing and every American had a personal stake in its course. Soldiers were recruited, supplied, trained, and transported. Casualties were high and many civilians helped care for the wounded. Those on the home front raised money, provided comfort and longed for news of their loved ones. Visual images such as maps, photographs, cartoons and prints told the story as it unfolded. Traditional means such as letters, diaries and sketches also provided detailed accounts of the conflict.</p>","order":2,"attachments":[{"id":738,"caption":"<p>\"Historical sketch of the rebellion,\" 1962.
