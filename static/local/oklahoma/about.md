# About

The OKHUB officially joined the DPLA network in 2017 through a partnership between the Oklahoma Department of Libraries, Oklahoma Historical Society, Oklahoma State University Library, and the University of Oklahoma Libraries ([See more](https://dp.la/news/oklahoma-hub-collections-now-discoverable-in-dpla/)).

The OKHUB is a [DPLA member hub](https://pro.dp.la/hubs) since 2017. You can find out more about adding your digitally available archival material to the DPLA through the OKHUB  by checking out [Participate](/participate).

We would love to talk to you about the process.
