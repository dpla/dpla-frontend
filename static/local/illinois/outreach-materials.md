# Outreach Materials

Interested in raising awareness of your institution's contributed materials and the IDHH? Consider posting or circulating some of the materials below. Whether your audience is K-12 teachers and learners, college students and instructors, new partners or providers, or folks interested in local history and genealogy, there is something for just about everyone. The following materials try to reach various members of this diverse group of users. These beautiful flyers, postcards, and posters were designed by the talented **Tath Haver**, graduate assistant on the IDHH project, with materials from the IDHH collections generously contributed by the institutions cited who graciously allowed the IDHH to use the images featured.
