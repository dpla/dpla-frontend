# Getting Started

## Who can participate

Libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions from anywhere in Illinois that would like to contribute to the IDHH may share access to their digital collections’ metadata.

## How to get started

If your digital collections are already part of [CARLI Digital Collections](https://collections.carli.illinois.edu/) or the [Illinois Digital Archive](http://www.idaillinois.org/), please speak with your contact at [CARLI](https://www.carli.illinois.edu/) or the [Illinois State Library](https://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/library/) to find out how to participate in the IDHH.

All other institutions who wish to contribute new items, including those who have already provided collections to the IDHH, should begin by completing the [Contributor Agreement form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By5ezltuoaTHM016a215dXJHbk0) and returning it to the [IDHH Coordinator](/about/contact). Once the form has been completed, IDHH staff will work with your institution to gather technical information about your collections and metadata and begin testing. Once again, institutions that have already completed contributor agreement forms for collections already provided will need to complete new agreement forms for any and all new collections they wish to contribute.

New providers or current contributors whose OAI endpoints have changed should complete a technical information form and return it to the [harvesting manager](/about/contact) and [metadata manager](/about/contact). This form provides IDHH staff with information they need to begin gathering and assessing your collections’ metadata.

## How it works

Institutions provide their metadata to the IDHH, usually via [OAI-PMH 2.0](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/). If your institution’s system is unable to provide an OAI feed, the IDHH can help investigate alternative methods for harvesting records. All metadata should be mapped to [Qualified Dublin Core](http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) whenever possible; otherwise, the IDHH can work with you to begin the mapping process.

The IDHH uses the open-source application [REPOX](http://repox.sysresearch.org) to harvest and aggregate collection metadata from all contributing institutions. DPLA then harvests a single stream of all aggregated metadata from the IDHH REPOX server for inclusion in the DPLA catalog.
