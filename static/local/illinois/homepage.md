Established in 2015 by four institutions, the Chicago Public Library, the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries of Illinois, the Illinois State Library, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the content of the IDHH is made possible by a network of more than one hundred contributors from across the state.
