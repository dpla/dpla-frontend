![IDHH harvest workflow illustration, described below](/static/local/illinois/idhh-harvest-workflow.PNG  "IDHH Harvest Workflow Overview")

1. **On-boarding**
   - Institution consents to providing metadata for specific collections, by completing the [contributor agreement form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By5ezltuoaTHM016a215dXJHbk0) and returning it to the [IDHH Coordinator](/about/contact).
   - Institution provides technical information on their digital library system necessary for testing, metadata assessment, and harvest by completing the [technical information form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1moX_IVbjwd0twLPUD7Pan5SMlW3f695K-r4udlgNd1c) and providing it to the [harvesting manager](/about/contact) and [metadata manager](/about/contact).

2. **Test harvesting and metadata assessment**
   - IDHH determines if metadata is harvestable with OAI-PMH and determines the metadata schema
   - IDHH harvests metadata with REPOX test server
   - IDHH assesses harvested metadata to check how it conforms with the DPLAâ€™s standards

3. **Metadata Remediation**
   - IDHH provides metadata assessment to contributor
   - Contributor makes required changes and any recommended changes they care to undertake
   - Contributor communicates with IDHH that metadata changes have been made and collections are ready for harvest

4. **Harvesting Metadata into Production**
   - IDHH harvests metadata into REPOX Production server
   - Production server performs some automated transformations on metadata

5. **DPLA Harvest**
   - DPLA harvests metadata
   - DPLA Indexes metadata and provides it in catalog

6. **Future Harvests**
   - IDHH will reharvest collections on a quarterly basis, approximately every January, April, July, and October
   - Any metadata changes contributors make to collections between harvests will appear in the DPLA catalog after collections are first reharvest by the IDHH and then by the DPLA
