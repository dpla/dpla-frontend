## Sharing our Stories. Exploring our Past.

The Sunshine State Digital Network (SSDN) is the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) Service Hub for the state of Florida. The service hub represents a community of institutions in the state which will provide their partner institutionsâ€™ aggregated metadata for the DPLA and offer tiered services to connect institutions of all sizes to the DPLA. We are a proud member of the DPLA Hub Network and our membership is supported through generous funding provided by the Library Services and Technology Act administered by the Florida Department of State, Division of Library and Information Services.
