## Charlotte Vandine Forten
### 1785&#8211;1884
[Charlotte Vandine Forten](/search?q=Charlotte+Vandine+Forten) was the matriarch of a financially well-off and prominent Black family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Forten's husband James was a sailmaker. Her daughters [Margaretta Forten](/search?q=Margaretta+Forten), [Sarah Louise Forten Purvis](/search?q=Sarah+Louise+Forten+Purvis) and [Harriet D. Forten Purvis](/search?q=Harriet+D+Forten+Purvis), often referred to as the "Forten Sisters," were, along with their parents, active in the abolitionist movement. James Forten was a member of the [American Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=American+Anti-Slavery+Society), but as the group did not permit women to join, Charlotte and her daughters joined with a like-minded group of women to form the [Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=Philadelphia+Female+Anti-Slavery+Society) in 1833. This was the first biracial organization of female abolitionists in the United States, and one of six abolitionist groups the Forten family helped to found and finance.

## Sojourner Truth
### c. 1797&#8211;1893
Abolitionist, temperance advocate and women's rights crusader [Sojourner Truth](/search?q=Sojourner+Truth) was born Isabella Bomefree (or Baumfree) to Dutch-speaking enslaved parents in a Dutch community in Ulster County, New York around 1797. At just nine years old, Truth was sold at auction to a farmer whom she remembered as cruel and violent. While still a child, she was sold several more times, suffering under a series of owners who beat her regularly. Eventually, Truth was sold to John and Elizabeth Dumont of West Park, New York. Truth learned to speak English while enslaved by the Dumonts. At around the age of 14, Truth was forced to marry an older man named Thomas who was also enslaved by the Dumonts. She is believed to have given birth to five children. As New York began to move toward abolition, Dumont promised Truth that he would grant her freedom on July 4, 1826, though when the date came, he reneged. Truth then decided to escape, and she walked away from the Dumont farm carrying her infant daughter in late 1826, finding sanctuary with a nearby white abolitionist family. The family bought her freedom for $20, about $500 in today's money. A law freeing the enslaved in New York took effect the next year. Soon after, Truth successfully sued the Dumonts for the return of her son Peter, whom they had illegally sold to farmers in Alabama; this made her one of the first Black women in America to prevail in court against a white man. In the early years of her freedom, Truth became a devoted Methodist, and in 1829, she moved to New York City, finding work as a housekeeper for two evangelist ministers; through them she was exposed to the state's religious revivalist movement, even living for a time in a religious commune. In 1843, believing she was called by God to travel around the country (or "sojourn") and preach truth, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth, moved to a Massachusetts utopian community and began working as an itinerant Methodist preacher, devoting herself to spreading Christianity and calling for the abolition of slavery. In her travels, she became acquainted with prominent abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and [Frederick Douglass](/search?q=Frederick+Douglass), among others, who encouraged her to give speeches denouncing slavery. She also met temperance advocates and women's rights pioneers like [Susan B. Anthony](/search?q=Susan+B+Anthony) and [Elizabeth Cady Stanton](/search?q=Elizabeth+Cady+Stanton), becoming increasingly involved in both causes and advocating for the then-radical idea of political equality for both Black and white women. Unable to read or write, Truth dictated her autobiography, The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, to Olive Gilbert and supported herself&#8212;including paying off the mortgage on her Massachusetts home&#8212;with the proceeds. A talented orator, Truth was invited in 1851 to give what has become her most well-known speech at the Ohio Women's Right Convention. It is often referred to as the "Ain't I A Woman?" speech, although evidence suggests that she did not actually employ this refrain in her talk. As her words were delivered extemporaneously, there is no original copy of the speech to consult, leaving only secondhand sources. (Scholars note that the source that reports the "Ain't I A Woman" refrain wasn't written until 12 years after the speech was given, while a more contemporaneous account does not include the phrase.) During the Civil War, Truth used her voice to help recruit Black soldiers to fight for the Union. She also worked for the [National Freedman's Relief Association](/search?q=National Freedmans+Relief+Association) to solicit donations and encourage relief efforts for Black refugees. Her work won her an audience with President Abraham Lincoln in October 1864. Even after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Truth continued her activism, riding whites-only streetcars in Washington, D.C. to protest segregation. When the war ended, Truth lobbied Congress to award western lands to the formerly enslaved, helping them achieve financial independence, but was unsuccessful. She continued to speak out about a variety of issues, including women's rights, prison reform and universal suffrage, until her death in Michigan in 1883.

## Harriet Forten Purvis
### 1810&#8211;1875
One of the well-known "Forten Sisters," [Harriet Forten Purvis](/search?q=Harriet+Forten+Purvis) was the daughter of Charlotte Vandine Forten and James Forten, prominent Black abolitionists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Like her sisters, she was an active abolitionist and suffragist. She helped establish the [Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=Philadelphia+Female+Anti-Slavery+Society) along with her mother and sisters; it was the first biracial women's abolitionist group in the United States. Forten served as a co-chair of the society's fairs, which raised money for the group's anti-slavery work. She also served on the society's sewing committee, which established a sewing school in a poor area of Philadelphia. She was active in the group's boycott of goods, including cotton and fruits and vegetables, that were produced with slave labor. In 1832, Forten married Robert Purvis, with whom she had five children. Purvis, who was of mixed race, was the scion of another prominent abolitionist family from Philadelphia, and the two were at the center of Philadelphia's abolitionist community. They welcomed fugitive slaves into their Byberry, Pennsylvania, home, which became a major station on the Underground Railroad. Abolition, however, was not Forten Purvis's only cause&#8212;she was also a firm believer in equality for all and women's rights. Along with her sister Margaretta, she helped organize the fifth National Woman's Rights Convention in Philadelphia in 1854 and was active with the [American Equal Rights Association](/search?q=American+Equal+Rights+Association) (AERA), a biracial group that advocated for universal suffrage. Forten Purvis also lectured on civil rights topics, speaking out against segregation in the years after the Civil War.

## Margaretta Forten
### c.1815&#8211;1875
A member of the prominent Forten family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Margaretta joined her sisters and mother in becoming a charter member of the [Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=Philadelphia+Female+Anti-Slavery+Society) in 1833 and was selected along with 13 others to draft the group's constitution. Like her sister [Harriet Forten Purivs](/search?q=Harriet+Forten+Purivs), Forten remained active in the group for its nearly four decades of existence, serving at different points as its recording secretary and treasurer and representing the group at statewide abolitionist meetings. She worked on the society's membership, education, petition campaign and annual antislavery fair committees, and was particularly active in the donation of books to Black schools. She also raised money for charitable causes related to abolition. Forten was an ardent suffragist, and was a member of the biracial [American Equal Rights Association](/search?q=American+Equal+Rights+Association) (AERA). She helped collect petitions for the Women's National League and helped organize the 1854 National Women's Rights Convention in Philadelphia. In addition to her work as an abolitionist and suffragist, Forten worked as an educator for nearly four decades, teaching and then founding her own grammar school in 1850. Forten never married, and cared for her parents in their later years.

## Mary Ann Shadd Cary
### 1823&#8211;1893
[Mary Ann Shadd](/search?q=Mary+Ann+Shadd) was born the eldest of 13 children to free Black parents in the slaveholding state of Delaware. Her parents were abolitionists and her childhood home was a stop on the Underground Railroad, which helped enslaved people escape to freedom in Canada. The Shadd family moved to Pennsylvania to escape Delaware's prohibition on the education of Black children, and Shadd attended a Quaker-run school there. She became a teacher, working in Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware, but after the 1850 passage of the Fugitive Slave Act, she moved to Canada, where Shadd believed she could more effectively advocate for abolition. She began writing articles urging American Blacks to move North and giving advice on settling in Canada, and in 1853, she became the editor of the [Provincial Freeman](/search?q=Provincial+Freeman), a newspaper written expressly for Blacks and escaped slaves. Published under the motto "Self-Reliance is the Fine Road to Independence," it was the first newspaper in North America to be edited by an African American woman and Canada's first anti-slavery newspaper. In her writings, Shadd was critical of the male-dominated abolitionist groups that she believed spoke too much and did too little. Shadd frequently took risky trips back to the United States to gather news for her paper, speak to Blacks about life in Canada and sell the subscriptions that paid for the printing of the paper. In 1856, she married a Canadian named Thomas Cary. The couple had two children together before his death several years later. In 1859, facing financial difficulties, the Provincial Freeman ceased publication and Shadd Cary worked as a teacher in an integrated school in Chatham, Ontario. She returned to the United States after the outbreak of the Civil War, working to recruit Black soldiers to the Union war effort. After the war, she moved to Washington, D.C. where she opened a school for the children of newly freed Blacks. In 1870, she became the first Black woman in U.S. history to earn a law degree and became active in the women's suffrage movement. Addressing the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in 1874, she urged them to rectify the fact that although she paid equal taxes, she did not have equal rights. In 1880, Shadd Cary founded the Colored Women's Progressive Franchise Association, which urged Black women to fight for suffrage and equal rights, in Washington, D.C.

## Frances Ellen Watkins Harper
### 1825&#8211;1911
A 19th-century poet, writer, abolitionist, speaker and temperance and suffrage activist, [Frances Ellen Watkins Harper](/search?q=Frances+Ellen+Watkins+Harper) was born to free Black parents in slaveholding Maryland in 1825. Orphaned at age 3, Harper attended the William Watkins Academy for Negro Youth, which was run by her uncle, and had already attained a high-quality education when she left school at age 14. Despite her schooling, she could only find domestic work, and was employed by a Quaker family who ran a bookstore. Exposed to a wide array of literature, Harper continued to write poetry as she had in her youth, and in 1845, she published her first collection of poems, Forest Leaves. She later moved to Ohio, where she taught at Union Seminary (later Wilberforce University), which was led by noted abolitionist John Brown. After a brief tenure teaching in Pennsylvania, she became a traveling abolitionist speaker and worked to help enslaved people escape the South via the Underground Railroad. She continued to write and publish, including a successful second book of poetry, Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects, in 1854. Harper donated a portion of her book sales to fund the Underground Railroad. Harper was a frequent contributor of articles and poems to anti-slavery newspapers, including [The Liberator](/search?q=The+Liberator), published by abolitionist Frederick Douglass. As a lecturer for the Maine Anti-Slavery Society, she traveled throughout New England, southern Canada and some western states, while continuing to publish poems and articles on a variety of subjects, including slavery, women's rights and temperance. In 1860, Harper married and had a child, after which she wrote less frequently. But, upon the death of her husband in 1864, she returned to the lecture circuit, writing and traveling extensively while advocating for women's rights and civil rights. As a member of the [American Equal Rights Association](/search?q=American+Equal+Rights+Association) (AERA), she worked alongside white suffragists, and gave a stirring speech at the 1866 National Women's Rights Convention, entitled "We Are All Bound Up Together," in which she spoke about white suffragists, saying "I do not believe that white women are dew-drops just exhaled from the skies. I think that like men they may be divided into three classes, the good, the bad, and the indifferent...You white women speak here of rights. I speak of wrongs." She left AERA to form the [American Woman Suffrage Association](/search?q=American+Woman+Suffrage+Association) when AERA leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton made racist statements about Black men and refused to support the passage of the 15th Amendment, which granted Black men the right to vote. As the turn of the century neared, Harper continued her activism on behalf of women and African Americans, working in the Colored Section of the [Women's Christian Temperance Union](/search?q=Womens+Christian+Temperance+Union) and as the director of the American Association of Colored Youth. In 1896, she co-founded the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) with other Black women activists, serving as its vice president in 1897. During the course of her career, she experimented with new literary styles; published more than a dozen books and countless articles and essays; and was the most popular Black poet of her time, earning her the nickname "bronze muse." Harper died in 1911 in her adopted home of Philadelphia.

## Sarah Remond
### c.1826&#8211;1894
[Sarah Remond](/search?q=Sarah+Remond) was the daughter of a prominent free Black abolitionist family in Salem, Massachusetts. In addition to advocating for abolition, the Remond family was a vocal critic of school segregation and pushed for integrated schools in Salem, which became the first town in Massachusetts to enact integrated public schools in 1844. An avid reader, Remond become Involved in the abolitionist cause at a young age and frequently attended anti-slavery lectures in Salem and Boston. In 1853, she purchased a ticket to attend an opera at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston, but was then forcibly removed from the theater on account of her race. In response, she successfully sued the theater and won a small cash settlement. In 1856, at age 30, Remond joined her brother Charles on his lecture tour of New York, even giving short speeches at several stops. Over the course of the next two years, she gave lectures at anti-slavery meetings in several states. In 1858, she left the U.S. for England, on a mission to win English support for the abolitionist cause. Her lectures describing the atrocities of slavery and racial injustice were well-received. In addition to giving 45 lectures in 25 cities and towns across England, Ireland and Scotland, Remond also pursued continued education at the Bedford College for Ladies. After the Civil War, she continued to live in London, where she became a member of the [London Emancipation Society](/search?q=London+Emancipation+Society) and the [Freedmen's Aid Association](/search?q=Freedmens+Aid+Association), working to raise money and supplies for the newly emancipated. Remond left London for Florence in 1866, where she attended medical school and then practiced medicine for two decades.

## Charlotte Forten Grimk&eacute;
### 1837&#8211;1914
Charlotte Forten Grimk&eacute; was born into the prominent Black abolitionist Forten family in Philadelphia. Her paternal grandparents were the abolitionists and equal rights advocates Charlotte Vandine Forten and James Forten. Forten's mother died when she was just 3 years old, and her father, Robert Bridges Forten, did not want her to attend Philadelphia's segregated schools. Instead, at 16 years old, she was sent to the more progressive Salem, Massachusetts, where she boarded with the Remond family, who were also prominent Black abolitionists. She began keeping a diary while studying at Higginson Grammar School for Girls, where she was the only Black student. These diaries became a lifelong habit and they were posthumously published in 1988, offering insight into Black life in the final years of slavery and the time immediately after abolition. During her time in Salem, Forten became a member of the [Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=Salem+Female+Anti-Slavery+Society) and was active in sewing items to sell at the group's annual anti-slavery fundraising fairs, as well as a frequent attendee of anti-slavery lectures. In 1856, Forten became the first-ever Black graduate of what would become Salem State University. Wishing to support herself without the help of a husband, she became a teacher at an all white-school in Salem and began writing poetry, some of which was published in William Lloyd son's [The Liberator](/search?q=The+Liberator). Following in her family's activist footsteps, Forten moved to the Sea Islands of South Carolina in 1862 as part of an effort to educate enslaved people on plantations abandoned by their owners when Union forces gained control of the area at the beginning of the Civil War. Although she left the islands after the death of her father and repeated bouts of pneumonia in 1864, she wrote about her time there in the two-part essay "Life in the Sea Islands," which was published in Atlantic Monthly. The essay depicted a Black population eager to learn, support themselves and assume the new responsibilities of citizenship. Back in Massachusetts, she served as secretary of the [Freedmen's Union Commission's](/search?q=Freedmens+Union+Commission) Boston branch. Forten later returned to teaching in South Carolina and at an all-black school in Washington, D.C. and clerked at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. When she was 41, Forten married the Reverend Francis Grimk&eacute;, who was 13 years her junior. Grimk&eacute; was the son of a white plantation owner named Henry Grimk&eacute; and his black enslaved worker Nancy Weston. He and his brother Archibald, who would become the executive director of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP), became free at the end of the Civil War. Grimk&eacute;'s education at Lincoln University was subsidized by his aunts, the white abolitionist and suffragist sisters Sarah and Angelina Grimk&eacute;. After her marriage, Forten Grimk&eacute; continued her activism, joining the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW) and advocating for women's suffrage. She also continued to write poetry and essays calling for an end to racial injustice and violence.

## Harriet Purvis, Jr.
### 1839&#8211;1904
The daughter of prominent abolitionists and equal rights activists Harriet Forten Purvis and Robert Purvis, Harriet Purvis, Jr., known as Hattie, grew up in a household that was at the center of the abolitionist movement in Pennsylvania, as well as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Her parents associated with a variety of well-known social reformers including Susan B. Anthony and Lucretia Mott. She attended the highly progressive Friends Eagleswood School, a coeducational and biracial institution in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, founded by abolitionist Theodore Weld. From a young age, Purvis was active in abolitionist and women's rights work. Considered part of the second generation of American suffragists, she became a member of the [Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society](/search?q=Philadelphia+Female+Anti-Slavery+Society), founded in part by her grandmother, mother and aunts,  in 1866. From 1866 to 1869, she worked with her mother on the group's annual anti-slavery fair to raise funds for the group's abolitionist activities. A committed suffragist, she attended the 1866 National Woman's Rights Convention and became a member of the [American Equal Rights Association](/search?q=American+Equal+Rights+Association) (AERA), a group she served as corresponding and recording secretary until the group ceased operations in 1869. She joined the Pennsylvania Woman's Suffrage Association, serving on its executive committee, and was a delegate to the National Woman's Suffrage Association from 1883 to 1900, as well as the group's  first African-American vice president. She worked closely for much of her life with Susan B. Anthony to advocate for women's rights. Purvis was also active in the temperance movement, joining the [Woman's Christian Temperance Union](/search?q=Woman's+Christian+Temperance+Union) (WCTU) and encouraging Black women to embrace the movement.

## Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin
### 1842&#8211;1924
Civil rights activist, suffragist and publisher Josephine St. Pierre was born in Boston in 1842. Her father was a leader of Boston's Black community in the years before the Civil War. At 16, she married John Ruffin, a barber who went on to become the first-ever Black graduate of Harvard Law School and the first African American to serve as a judge in Massachusetts. Early in their marriage, the Ruffins moved to England to protest the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which bolstered the system of slavery in the United States and ruled that Congress could not prohibit slavery in U.S. territories. After returning to Boston to advocate for abolition, Ruffin and her husband recruited Black soldiers for Massachusetts regiments of the Union Army during the Civil War, including the much-lauded Massachusetts 54th.  In 1879, she founded the Boston Kansas Relief Association, which raised money to help African Americans who had migrated to Kansas. A committed believer in women's rights and civil rights, Ruffin was a charter member of the [Massachusetts School Suffrage Association](/search?q=Massachusetts+School+Suffrage+Association), which pushed for women to be able to vote in school board elections, as well as run for school board positions. Her work with school suffrage brought her into contact with suffragists Julia Ward Howe and Lucy Stone, who invited her to join the "New England Women's Club]; she was the group's first African-American member. Ruffin worked as a writer for the Black newspaper The Courant and was a member of the New England Women's Press Association. In 1893, she co-founded the Woman's Era Club, the first club founded and managed by Black women in Boston. The club published the Woman's Era newspaper, which was the first newspaper in America published for and by Black women. It is also known for publishing the early writings of activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett. In 1895, Ruffin organized the first national conference of Black women's clubs, which resulted in the formation of National Federation of Afro-American Women. That group merged with the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW) in 1896; Ruffin served as NACW's first vice president. Ruffin was a consistent critic of all-white national women's clubs like the [Women's Christian Temperance Union](/search?q=Womens+Christian+Temperance+Union) and spoke out about the dual burden faced by Black women. In 1900 she was invited to attend a Milwaukee conference of the [General Federation of Women's Clubs](/search?q=General+Federation+of+Womens+Clubs) as a member of the three organizations: the Woman's Era Club, the New England Women's Press Association and the New England Women's Club. When organizers discovered that the Woman's Era Club was a Black organization, she was told she would only be able to sit as a member of the predominantly white clubs to which she belonged. A white conference attendee even attempted to grab her badge from her. She refused to sit at all, and the event was nationally publicized as the "Ruffin incident." In 1910, Ruffin helped to found the Boston chapter of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP). She died in Boston in 1924.

## Charlotte "Lottie" Rollin
### 1849&#8211;?
Charlotte Rollin, known as Lottie, was the second eldest of the well-known Rollin Sisters of South Carolina. Rollin's mixed-race parents were financially prosperous and Lottie and her sisters Frances Ann, Kate, Louisa and Florence Rollin all attended secondary school in the North and became early women's suffrage activists. After the Civil War, Lottie and her sister Kate established a school for freedmen in Charleston. The family moved to Columbia, and Lottie went on to work as a clerk at the South Carolina State House. The sisters were influential in the politics of the Reconstruction-era South and held well-attended salons at the Columbia, South Carolina residence that the four younger sisters shared. In 1869, Rollin gave a speech on the floor of the South Carolina House of Representatives in favor of universal suffrage. The next year, she was the chair and founder of the South Carolina Woman's Rights Association, and in 1871, she led a meeting at the state capitol pushing for women's suffrage. A member of the [American Woman Suffrage Association](/search?q=American+Woman+Suffrage+Association) (AWSA) and the organizer of its South Carolina chapter, Rollin wrote in an 1871 article in the AWSA's Woman's Journal: "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings and as such entitled to all human rights."  In 1872, Rollin worked alongside her sisters, as well as AWSA leader Lucy Stone, to push for an ultimately unsuccessful constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage in South Carolina.  As Reconstruction came to an end, and Blacks began to lose their hard-won political power, Rollin feared persecution from the Ku Klux Klan and left South Carolina for Brooklyn.

## Fannie Barrier Williams
### 1855&#8211;1944
Civil rights activist and suffragist Frances "Fannie" Barrier Williams was born in the western New York town of Brockport in 1855. Her family was one of the few Black families in the area. Her father was a successful businessman, homeowner and active in town affairs. The entire family was active in Brockport's First Baptist Church, of which they were the only Black members and where Barrier often sang and played the piano. As a child, she attended Brockport public schools, and in 1870, she became the first African-American graduate of the teacher training college Brockport State Normal School, which is now SUNY Brockport. After graduation, she taught at several schools for freedmen in the South and experienced intense racial discrimination for the first time in her life. Unsettled by the realities of life in the Jim Crow-era South, she returned north, studying portrait painting in Washington, D.C. and music at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music. While in Washington, D.C., she met the man who would become her husband, S. Laing Williams, who was studying to become an attorney. After he completed his law studies, the two married and relocated to Illinois, where he worked as an assistant lawyer and later became a Chicago assistant district attorney. Williams, meanwhile, became the director of art and music at the Prudence Crandall Study Club literary society, an organization of Chicago's African-American elites. She also became involved in the reform and women's suffrage movements, and contributed to the Hyde Park Colored Voters Republican Club. As part of her work with the Illinois Women's League, she gave lectures on the importance of suffrage for Black women. In 1891, helped found the interracial Provident Hospital to create opportunities for Black doctors and nurses, as well as its associated nursing school for Black women. In order to advocate for more resources for Black women, including access to education, childcare, employment assistance and banks, Williams helped to found the [National League of Colored Women](/search?q=National+League+of+Colored+Women) in 1893.Three years later, she was active in the merging of this group with others to form the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW). During the planning of the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, she worked to have African Americans included in the planning process and to ensure representation in the exhibits. She also gave a speech entitled "The Intellectual Progress and Present Status of the Colored Women of the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation," to the Departmental Congress of the National Association of Loyal Women of American Liberty at the [World's Congress of Representative Women](/search?q=Worlds+Congress+of+Representative+Women), in which she described the obstacles facing Black women searching for employment, arguing that ability and talent counted "for nothing." Several months later, she gave a speech to the [World's Parliament of Religions](/search?q=Worlds+Parliament+of+Religions) about racial equality within religious organizations, and the important role that organized religion could play in building a better society. With these two speeches, she gained a national reputation and became a sought after speaker. She was nominated for membership in the exclusive [Chicago Women's Club](/search?q=Chicago+Womens+Club), setting off a long debate within the all-white club about granting membership to a Black woman and prompting several resignations when she was accepted in 1895. Her history of the Black women's club movement was published in 1902, which, she wrote, had grown to 400 clubs with a total membership of more than 150,000. In 1905, Williams and her husband, along with several other families, founded the Frederick Douglass Center settlement project. She also served as a reporter for Woman's Era, a newspaper published by fellow suffragist Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and her daughter, to provide news reports for and by Black women, while also writing for the Chicago Record-Herald and the New York Age. After the death of white suffragist leader Susan B. Anthony in 1907, Williams was the only Black woman asked to speak at Anthony's funeral.  In 1909, Williams was active in the creation of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP).  In 1924, after the death of her husband, she became the first Black woman to sit on the Chicago Library Board. Williams returned to Brockport, New York, in 1926 and died there in 1944 at the age of 89.

## Mary Church Terrell
### 1863&#8211;1954
Racial justice and women's suffrage activist [Mary Church Terrell](/search?q=Mary+Church+Terrell) was born in 1863 in Memphis, Tennessee, to formerly enslaved parents. Her family was affluent: Her mother, Louisa Ayres Church, owned a hair salon, and her father, Robert Reed Church, was an entrepreneur who owned several businesses and became one of the first African-American millionaires in the American South. Church's parents valued education, and, though her parents divorced, she studied at Antioch College and earned a degree from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1884. Church, who was fluent in three languages, then worked as a teacher at Ohio's Wilberforce College. In 1887, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was a teacher at M Street Colored High School and met her husband, fellow teacher Robert Heberton Terrell. At the 1890 National Woman Suffrage Assocation Convention, Terrell called attention to the "dual burden" faced by Black women, saying, "A White Woman has only one handicap to overcome&#8212;a great one, true, her sex; a colored woman faces two&#8212;her sex and her race. A colored man has only one&#8212;that of race." In 1892, after a friend of hers was lynched in Memphis by whites, Terrell became involved with anti-lynching activism along with [Ida B. Wells-Barnett](). She helped to found the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW) in 1896, and served as its first president until 1901. Terrell believed in the philosophy of "racial uplift," arguing that Black people could advance the cause of racial equality through self-help, including education, hard work and community involvement. She captured this idea in the phrase "Lifting as we climb," which was adopted by NACW as its motto. She led the NACW in creating kindergartens, child care and Mother Clubs to help support working Black women. According to historian Beverly Johnson, she also began to espouse the idea of interracial understanding, believing that education would lead to improved cooperation between races. In 1909, Terrell helped to found the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP), and the next year, co-founded the [College Alumnae Club](/search?q=College+Alumnae+Club), which later became the National Association of University Women. Terrell believed that women's suffrage was essential to progress for Black women, and worked extensively with both Black and white women's suffrage groups, even picketing the White House with the [National Woman's Party](/search?q=National+Womans+Party). After the passage of the 19th Amendment, she continued to advocate for civil rights and and end to racial discrimination, and her activism continued unabated in her later years. In 1940, she published an autobiography detailing her experience with discrimination, A Colored Woman in a White World. During World War II, she spoke out about the injustice of Black soldiers fighting for freedom abroad while being discriminated against at home. She filed a successful discrimination lawsuit against the American Association of University Women after they denied her entry, and became its first Black member in 1948. She challenged segregation in Washington, D.C. using techniques like boycotts, pickets and sit-ins that would become more popular as the civil rights movement wore on. Perhaps most famously, she and other activists filed a lawsuit&#8212;when she was in her 80s&#8212;challenging segregation in a Washington, D.C., restaurant. This led to a landmark 1953 Supreme Court ruling that outlawed segregation in dining facilities. Terrell died in Maryland in 1954, ending her more than 65-year-long career or activism.

## Mary Talbert
### 1866&#8211;1923
Civil rights activist, anti-lynching crusader, suffragist and educator [Mary Morris Burnett Talbert](/search?q=Mary+Morris+Burnett+Talbert) was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1866. At age 19, she completed her degree in 1886 from Oberlin College, where she was the only African-American woman in her graduating class. After college, Talbert taught and was an assistant principal at Bethel University in Arkansas before becoming the principal of Union High School in Little Rock. A trailblazer, Burnett was the only African-American woman to hold such a position in all of Arkansas. After marrying William Talbert in 1891, the couple moved to Buffalo, where she became active in the politically minded Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. She helped found the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Colored Women, which later merged with the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW). Talbert gained prominence for her protest of the all-white board of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, which was to be held in Buffalo. She demanded the appointment of a Black board member and called for an exhibit showcasing African-American life. In 1905, Talbert and her husband hosted a secret meeting of civil rights activists led by [W.E.B. DuBois](/search?q=WEB+dubois) at her home. The group adopted a series of civil rights resolutions that formed the basis of the [Niagara Movement](/search?q=Niagara+Movement)&#8212;so named for the Talbert home's proximity to Niagara Falls&#8212;that pushed for equality for Black men and was a forerunner of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP). Although Talbert, as a woman, was excluded from that initial meeting, she went on to serve as vice president and a board member of the NAACP from 1918 until her death in 1923. She also served as NACW president from 1916 to 1920, and it was under her leadership that the NACW was accepted as a full member of the International Council of Women (ICW). In 1920, at the ICW's annual conference, Talbert argued that white women were "duty bound to lift \[their\] voices against the ills that afflict \[their\] sisters of color." A year before her death, Talbert became the first female recipient of the NAACP's prestigious Springarn Medal for her lifetime of work on behalf of women of color.

## Lugenia Burns Hope
### 1871&#8211;1947
Suffragist, activist and community organizer Lugenia Burns Hope was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1871, and grew up in St. Louis and Chicago, Illinois. One of seven children, economic hardship forced her to leave school early. Her interest in activism and social work was sparked by her first jobs working at several settlement houses in the Chicago area, including [Hull House](/search?q=Hull+House). In the early 1890s she furthered her education, studying at the Chicago Art Institute, Chicago School of Design and Chicago Business College. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, she met John Hope, who was then a theology student at Brown University, and the two married in 1897, moving first to Nashville, where they both taught at Roger Williams University, and then to Hope's native Georgia. In Atlanta, Hope initially worked to provide childcare and access to kindergarten for working mothers in the Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College) community, where her husband worked. John Hope became the college's president in 1906. The couple went on to have two sons, and she was an active mother, despite her many and growing responsibilities, and even sewed most of her children's clothes herself. In 1908, she helped to create the [Neighborhood Union](/search?q=Neighborhood+Union), a social welfare agency run by Black women that provided access to education, training, employment assistance, recreational opportunities and healthcare to Atlanta's African-American communities. From 1908 to 1935, she headed the Neighborhood Union, becoming one of the most influential, effective and well-known Black leaders in the American South and developing a reputation as an outspoken, courageous and sometimes radical fighter for racial and gender equality. With the motto, "Thy Neighbor as Thyself," the Neighborhood Union worked to deliver needed services to Atlanta's Black families, and determined these needs by dividing the city up into sections, with each section's representative reporting into the larger organization. In this way, the Neighborhood Union ensured representation and became a much-looked-to model for community organization. Under Hope's leadership, the Union was active in the fight against segregation and discrimintation and established the nation's first African-American high school and first public housing for African Americans. Hope espoused interracial cooperation to help right social ills. During World War I, Hope was appointed Special War Work Secretary for the War Work Council of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). These councils provided black soldiers with recreational and relaxation opportunities that only white soldiers received through the USO. While working with the YWCA, Hope spoke out against the racism she saw in the larger organization, pushing for Black leaders to be able to make decisions about services in Black communities. Hope then worked with the YWCA to create a nationwide network of [Hostess Houses](/search?q=Hostess+Houses) that provided services for Black and Jewish servicemen and their families. Hope was also active in anti-lynching campaign, pushing for a federal anti-lynching law. Hope allied in this fight with a group of white Southern Methodist women, but came away disappointed by the white women's ultimate failure to confront their own racism. In addition to her work with the Neighborhood Union, Hope helped to found the Atlanta chapter of the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW), and worked with that group in support of women's suffrage, which she called the "safeguard of the nation."  In 1932, Hope became the First Vice President of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She worked with the NAACP to create "citizenship schools," which taught classes on voting, democracy and the Constitution; these schools were then replicated in other areas of the country and helped inspire methods used by groups like [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee](/search?q=Student+Non-Violent+Coordinating+Committee) (SNCC) and the [Congress of Racial Equality](/search?q=Congress+of+Racial+Equality) (CORE) during the Civil Rights Movement. Hope traveled nationally and internationally with her husband on fundraising tours for Morehouse College, and she was influential in his decision to accept the role of president of Atlanta University, where he led the creation of the first African-American graduate school in the country. After her husband's 1936 death, Hope moved to New York City, where she worked for [Mary McLeod Bethune](/search?q=Mary+McLeod+Bethune), who was then heading Negro Affairs for the National Youth Administration, and later lived in Chicago and Nashville. She died in Nashville in 1947.

## Nannie Helen Burroughs
### 1879&#8211;1961
Educator, suffragist and religious leader Nannie Helen Burroughs was born in 1879 in Orange, Virginia. Her father was the son of an enslaved man who had managed to buy his freedom; her mother was formerly enslaved. When she was a young child, her father died and she moved with her mother to Washington, D.C. so that she could pursue an education superior to that available to her in Virginia. She attended Washington, D.C.'s M Street Colored High School, where the suffragists and activists Mary Church Terrell and Anna Julia Cooper, who would exert great influence on her life, were among her teachers. After graduating in 1898, racial discrimination prevented her from obtaining a teaching position in the Washington, D.C. public schools and she instead took a position working for a Baptist newspaper in Philadelphia. She went on to work for the National Baptist Convention (NBC) Foreign Mission Board, and later for the NBC's corresponding secretary, eventually relocating to work for him in Louisville, Kentucky. While in Louisville, she founded a club to offer evening vocational classes, work that presaged her eventual career in education. At the 1900 NBC convention, Burroughs gave a speech she called, "How the Sisters are Hindered from Helping," which discussed the injustices women faced within the Black Baptist church. The speech helped to build her national reputation and create momentum for a greater role for women in the church. Later that year, along with Mary Virginia Cook-Parrish, she founded the National Baptist Women's Convention, which later morphed into the NBC Women's Auxiliary. Burroughs served as the Convention's corresponding secretary from 1900 to 1948, when she was elected the group's president, a position she held until her death. Thanks in large part to Burroughs' work traveling the country to organize Baptist women, the group became one of the largest and most influential Black women's groups in the United States, with a membership of nearly 1 million women in 1903 and 1.5 million by 1907. She organized what would become an annual celebration of the Women Convention's National Woman's Day, which honored sisterhood within the church and served as a fundraiser for the group, in 1908. With her leadership, the Convention advocated for a number of the causes Burroughs supported, including the anti-lynching  movement, desegregation and increased educational opportunites for Black women and girls. In 1909, Burroughs led the Women's Convention in the establishment of the [National Training School for Women and Girls](/search?q=National+Training+School+for+Women+and+Girls), which was the first vocational school for Black women and girls in the country. The boarding high school and junior college provided academic studies (including courses in Black history), religious instruction and technical training in trades ranging from home economics to printing to shoe repair in order to prepare Black women for the workforce. The National Training School advocated for racial uplift through self-help and was unique in that it was staffed, managed and funded by African Americans. Burroughs herself worked as a teacher at the school, and dedicated much of the rest of her life to the education of Black women. Burroughs, along with many members of the Women's Convention, was a staunch supporter of women's voting rights, believing that they were the key to advancement for Blacks and women. Burroughs also believed that the vote could help protect women from abuse. She  was active within a network of influential Black women suffragists that included [Coralie Franklin Cook](/search?q=Coralie+Franklin+Cook), [Anna Julia Cooper](/search?q=Anna+Julia+Cooper) and [Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute;](/search?q=Angelina+Weld+Grimk&eacute;). She contributed articles in support of women's suffrage for the NAACP publication [The Crisis](/search?q=The+Crisis), including writing in the August 1915 issue, "The ballot, wisely used, will bring to her \[the African-American woman\] the respect and protection that she needs...She needs the ballot to reckon with men who place no value upon her virtue, and to mould healthy public sentiment in favor of her own protection." Burroughs was active in the [National Association of Colored Women](/search?q=National+Association+of+Colored+Women) (NACW), helping to galvanize Black women's support for  the 19th Amendment. She also contributed to the [Association for the Study of Negro Life and History](/search?q=Association+for+the+Study+of+Negro+Life+and+History) and, in 1920, created the National Association of Wage Earners (NAWE), an organization that advocated for the rights of domestic workers. In 1924, she helped to found the National League of Republican Colored Women and served as its president, becoming a popular political speaker in the 1920s. In 1928, President Herbert Hoover appointed her to chair a committee on housing for African Americans. Under the auspices of the NAACP, she endorsed boycotts and other types of protest to fight for an end to segregation and discrimination. In her later years, she remained a popular and respected leader and continued to speak out on issues of Black pride and education. She developed a close friendship and working relationship with civil rights leader [Martin Luther King, Jr.](), the son of her friends Martin Luther King, Sr. and his wife Alberta. This relationship was symbolic of the way in which Burroughs' work helped set a foundation for the Civil Rights Movement. Burroughs continued to lead the NBC Women's Auxiliary until her death in 1961. Several years later, the National Training School for Women and Girls that she founded was renamed the Nannie Helen Burroughs School.

## Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute;
### 1880&#8211;1958
Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute; was born into a prominent biracial abolitionist family from Boston. Her father was Archibald Grimk&eacute;, the son of a white plantation owner and enslaver and an enslaved woman of mixed race, and the nephew of the well-known white abolitionist and suffragist sisters Sarah and Angelina Grimk&eacute;. Her mother Sarah Stanley was from a middle-class Midwestern family. Grimk&eacute;'s parents split when she was just 3 years old, and although she initially lived with white mother, at 7 she was returned to her father's care and never saw her mother again. Raised by her well-off father, who was a lawyer and the executive director of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](/search?q=National+Association+for+the+Advancement+of+Colored+People) (NAACP), Grimk&eacute; was educated at some of the best schools in Massachusetts. She became an English teacher in her early 20s, working at the Armstrong Manual Training School and what would become Dunbar High School, both in Washington, D.C., and continuing her education in the summers. At Dunbar, Grimk&eacute; made the acquaintance of a group of Black women writers, and began writing about her observations of black life and racism, among other topics. Her writing, which included poetry, plays, essays and short stories, is often described as having helped lay the groundwork for the Harlem Renaissance. Among Grimk&eacute;'s most well-known works is the play Rachel, published in 1920 in response to NAACP founder [W.E.B. Dubois's]() call for the creation of theater by and for Black people. The play tells the story of a young Black woman who decides she will not bring children into a world plagued by racism. According to historian Elizabeth Brown-Guillory, it was the first play written by a Black woman to become a "fully staged professional production." In addition, Grimk&eacute;'s poetry has been included in several prominent anthologies of Black poetry. A supporter of women's suffrage like her well-known aunts, Grimk&eacute; believed that winning the vote was essential to ending injustice against women. She developed friendships with prominent suffragists and activists [Mary Church Terrell](/search?q=Mary+Church+Terrell) and [Coralie Franklin Cook](/search?q=Coralie+Franklin+Cook), both of whom were involved in the [National American Woman Suffrage Association](/search?q=National+American+Woman+Suffrage+Association) and black women's club movement, and she was active in an influential group of Washington, D.C.-based Black women suffragists that included Terrell and Cook, as well as [Nannie Helen Burroughs](/search?q=Nannie+Helen+Burroughs), [Anna Julia Cooper](/search?q=Anna+Julia+Cooper) and others. Grimk&eacute; died in 1958 in New York City. Her work is considered to have helped set the stage for the Harlem Renaissance.

## Fannie Lou Hamer
### 1917&#8211;1977
Civil rights and voting rights activist [Fannie Lou Hamer](/search?q=Fannie+Lou+Hamer) was born Fannie Lou Townsend in rural Mississippi in 1917. Her parents were sharecroppers and she was the youngest of their 20 children. Forced to start working the cotton fields with the rest of her family at age 6 because of her family's difficult financial circumstances, Hamer received only a sixth-grade education. She worked in the fields until 1942, when the plantation owner, W.D. Marlowe made Hamer, who could read and write, the plantation's time and record keeper. In 1945, Townsend married Perry Hamer, who also worked on Marlowe's plantation as a tractor driver. In 1961, Hamer had surgery to remove a tumor in her uterus; the white doctor performing the surgery also performed a hysterectomy without her consent, making it impossible for her to have children. This type of forced sterilization, performed by doctors without Black women's consent as a way to control the Black population, was common enough that it was referred to as a "Mississippi appendectomy." Hamer and her husband later adopted two children. In August 1962, Hamer began working with the [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee](/search?q=Student+Non-Violent+Coordinating+Committee) (SNCC)  as a volunteer attempting to register Black voters as part of SNCC's effort to challenge Mississippi's racially discriminatory voter registration practices. On August 31, she led a group of volunteers in an unsuccessful attempt to register to vote in Indianola, Mississippi. Not only was Hamer fired from her job in reprisal, the home she was staying in with friends was shot into repeatedly, though Hamer and her friends were unharmed. Determined to secure her right to vote, Hamer repeatedly took the literacy test and finally succeeded in registering to vote in 1963.  That same year she began working for SNCC as a field secretary and helped to create the [Delta ministry](/search?q=Delta+ministry), a community development program. That June, on the way home from a SNCC voter registration training with a group of other women, Hamer and the other women were arrested after stopping at a rest area in Winona, Mississippi. They were taken to Winona Jail, where they were savagely beaten; Hamer was left with injuries to her leg, kidney and eye that plagued her throughout her life, but she remained devoted to the causes of voting rights and civil rights.  In 1964, Hamer mounted an ultimately unsuccessful Congressional campaign, after the Democratic Party refused to put her name on the ballot. That same year, she helped to found the [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party](/search?q=Mississippi+Freedom+Democratic+Party) (MFDP), serving as its vice chair. That year, Hamer travelled with the MFDP to New Jersey, where she and other MFDP members attempted to challenge the all-white Democratic Party delegation from Mississippi. Although they were unsuccessful, the MFDP did secure a promise from the national Democratic Party to include Black delegates at the subsequent convention in 1968, and that year, Hamer herself served as a delegate. She continued to speak out for civil rights in her later years, even while battling cancer. Hamer died in 1977.
