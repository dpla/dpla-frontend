**1851**: Sojourner Truth delivers a speech at a women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio, despite attempts by white suffragists to prevent her from speaking. Although this speech is known as the "Ain't I a Woman" speech, Truth likely never used those words. The phrase was attributed to Truth years after the fact by white suffragists. See a comparison of the two speeches here. 

**1852**: Uncle Tom's Cabin by [Harriet Beecher Stowe](/search?q=Harriet+Beecher+Stowe) is published.

**1859**: Charles Remond declines a nomination to serve on the business committee at the New England Convention of Colored Citizens in Boston, saying that it was time for women to start assuming leadership positions in the group. [Ruth Remond](/search?q=Ruth+Remond) and [Eliza Logan Lawton](/search?q=Eliza+Logan+Lawton) were instead elected to the committee. 

**1865**: The American Civil War comes to an end. On December 6, 1865, the 13th Amendment is passed, abolishing slavery in the United States. 

In a letter to the editor of the New York Standard, Elizabeth Cady Stanton writes, in reference to Black men winning the vote, "In fact, it is better to be the slave of an educated white man, than of a degraded, ignorant Black one." (Davis, 44)

**1866**: [Frances E.W. Harper](/search?q=Frances+Harper) calls for women's suffrage at the 11th National Woman's Rights Convention in May, saying, "justice is not fulfilled so long as woman is unequal before the law."

The American Equal Rights Association (AERA) is founded. AERA advocates for and petitions Congress for universal suffrage. Sojourner Truth, Frances E.W. Harper, Margaretta Forten, Sarah Remond and Hattie Purvis among other Black women are active in the organization. Hattie Purvis serves on AERA's executive committee, serving at various times as the group's recording secretary and corresponding secretary. 

Both Black men and women participate in the founding of the interracial Philadelphia Suffrage Association. Harriet Purvis serves on the group's executive committee. 

Charlotte Rollin calls for universal suffrage in a speech in front of the South Carolina House of Representatives.

**1866&#8211;67**: Sarah and Charles Remond advocate for women's suffrage while lecturing throughout New York state, prior to the state's 1867 constitutional convention. Lawmakers do not include voting rights for women in the constitution. 

**1867**: Stanton supporter George Francis Train argues during a debate over suffrage in Kansas that to grant suffrage to Black men was "absurd, especially if white women were not enfranchised." (Terborg-Penn, 28)

Lucy Stone describes Republicans who criticized those opposed to Black suffrage as "unutterably contemptible from the lips or pens of those whose words, acts, and votes are not against ignorant and degraded negroes, but against every man's mother, wife, and daughter." 

**1868**: Senator Samuel Pomeroy (R-KS) introduces a federal universal suffrage amendment, but the Senate refuses to vote on it. 

Four Black women are among the 172 women who cast mock ballots in Vineland, New Jersey, after being blocked from participating in an election. This was part of a "New Departure" strategy to read the Fourteenth Amendment expansively as already granting women voting rights, since it confirmed their citizenship. This strategy, endorsed at the 1871 NWSA convention, was supported by black suffragists Mary Ann Shadd Cary and Sojourner Truth. (Terborg-Penn, 38)

William J. Whipper, husband of Charlotte Rollin, argues for suffrage for women and Black men while serving as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention. 

**1869**: AERA dissolves after infighting over support for the 15th Amendment, which would give African-American men the right to vote, but ignore women's suffrage. In the wake of AERA's demise, the movement splits: One group of white suffragists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, found the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). During this period, Stanton in particular expresses racist views, doubting the ability of Black men to be responsible voters. The resulting NWSA strategy "pitted Black men against women in a racist way." (Terborg-Penn, 27). Meanwhile, Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell and Julia Ward Howe form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The two groups move forward with different strategies: NWSA pursues a federal women's suffrage amendment, while AWSA takes a state-by-state approach. Black women join and are active in both groups, although more Black women choose the AWSA due to its support for suffrage for Black men, an important issue for Black women. Frances E.W. Harper, Charlotte Forten, [Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin](/search?q=Josephine+St+Pierre+Ruffin) and Sojourner Truth are among those that join the AWSA, while Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Harriet Purvis and Hattie Purvis are among those that join the NWSA. 

Wyoming becomes the first American territory to grant women suffrage. 

At the 1869 AERA meeting in New York City, Frances E.W. Harper weighs in on the Black suffrage vs. women's suffrage debate; she supports suffrage for Black men, saying "When it was a question of race, \[I\] let the lesser question of sex go. But the white women all go for sex, letting race occupy a minor positio (Terborg-Penn, 32)." (Harper, however, was not content with Black men's suffrage; she continued to fight for women's suffrage as well.) As white women at the meeting spoke out against suffrage for Black men, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton's remarks against the idea of "ignorant Negroes and foreigners to make laws for her to obey," Harper responded: "If the nation could handle only one question, \[I\] would not have Black women put a single straw in the way, if only the men of the race could obtain what they wanted." White feminists Lucy Stone and Abby Kelly Foster joined her in this position. (Terborg-Penn, 32)

Louisa Rollin speaks on the floor of the South Carolina House of Representatives in support of universal suffrage. 

**1870**: The Fifteenth Amendment is passed, giving African-American men the right to vote. 

Charlotte Rollin is elected secretary of the integrated South Carolina Woman's Rights Association and at that years convention, says, "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings, and as such entitled to all human rights." According to historian Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, Rollin's speech is the first by an African-American woman other than Sojourner Truth to be preserved by white suffrage leaders in their history of the suffrage movement. (Terborg-Penn, 45)

**1871**: Charlotte Rollin writes in an 1871 article in AWSA's Woman's Journal: "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings and as such entitled to all human rights." 

Charlotte Rollin leads a meeting at the South Carolina state capitol to advocate for women's suffrage. 

**1871&#8211;72**: Mary Ann Shadd Cary unsuccessfully attempts to register to vote in Washington, D.C., challenging the language of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Using her legal training, Cary unsuccessfully argues that as a taxpayer in the District of Columbia, she should have the same rights as male taxpayers. (Terborg-Penn, 38,39)

**1872**: Sojourner Truth shows up to vote at a polling station in Battle Creek, Michigan, but is turned away. 

White suffragist Virginia Minor and her husband Francis sue the St. Louis registrar for barring Virginia Minor from voting, arguing the Fourteenth Amendment has been misinterpreted. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually decides against the Minors. As a result of this case, suffragists realize they need to push for a new constitutional amendment rather than trying to challenge the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

**1873**: Frances E.W. Harper delivers the closing speech at the AWSA convention in New York City, saying, "much as white women need the ballot, colored women need it more." Harper also called for more intersectional demands like equal rights and equal access to education for Black women, which, according to historian Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, was likely a radical position to take in a single-issue organization like AWSA (Terborg-Penn, 47). 

Mrs. Beatty attends the inaugural convention of the NWSA-affiliated Oregon State Woman Suffrage Association, showing that Black women were active in the western women's suffrage movement (Terborg-Penn, 50).

**1874**:  The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is founded. Both Black and white women favor temperance because men's drinking led to increased incidents of domestic violence and to men spending the wages their families needed.The temperance and women's suffrage movements become allied, leading the liquor industry to become one of the suffragists' strongest opponents, as they believed that if women could vote, they'd outlaw liquor. Frances E.W. Harper was affiliated with the Philadelphia WCTU in the late 1870s and was appointed the national superintendent of the Department of Work Among Colored People, serving from 1883 to 1890. She was succeeded by Lucy Thurman of Michigan.

Mary Ann Shadd Cary addresses the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, calling out the hypocrisy that although she paid equal taxes to any man in Washington, D.C., she did not have equal rights, as she is not permitted to vote. 

**1876**: Mary Ann Shadd Cary writes to NWSA, asking that the names of 94 Black women from Washington, D.C. be added to a centennial autograph book as signers of the Women's Declaration of Sentiments. 

**1877**: Frances E.W. Harper addresses the Association for the Advancement of Women (AAW) Woman's Congress. Her talk, entitled, "The Colored Women of America," sets out the issues that would be taken up by [Mary Church Terrell](/search?q=Mary+Church+Terrell) and others in the NACW in 1890s (Collier-Thomas, 54).

**1878**: The Woman Suffrage amendment, written by Susan B. Anthony, is raised in Congress by California Senator A.A. Sargent. Although it ultimately fails, it includes the language that some 40 years later forms the basis for the 19th Amendment.

Mary Ann Shadd Cary announces that Black women, determined to win suffrage, "would support whatever party would allow them their rights, be it Republican or Democratic." 

**1879**: In Massachusetts, women are granted the right to vote in school board elections. 

**1880**: Mary Ann Shadd Cary founds the Colored Women's Franchise Association in Washington, D.C. to advocate for Black women's suffrage, political rights, expanded access to education and improved employment opportunities and working conditions. The group's tenure is short-lived, perhaps because of the radical nature of Cary's positions (Terborg-Penn, 84) or because she organized before black women formed their own national organization, with the 1896 founding of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). 

**1881**: [Gertrude Bustill Mossell](/search?q=Gertrude+Bustill+Mossell) writes an article entitled "Woman's Suffrage," in which she calls for readers to become better informed about the history of the suffrage movement and women's rights. The article is reprinted in the New York Freeman in 1885. 

**1884**: One year into her tenure as the leader of the WCTU, Frances E.W. Harper voices support for the temperance movement, saying "As a race, we have a right to be interested in the success of the temperance movement (Terborg-Penn, 85)." 

**1887**: The U.S. Senate votes against women's suffrage. 

**1890**: The AWSA and NWSA merge to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The new organization takes a state-by-state approach and is led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. One of the strategies the new group deploys is to sideline Black women in an effort to win the support of Southern white women (Terborg-Penn, 56). However, black women such as Mary Church Terrell attend NAWSA meetings and implore white suffragists to take the disenfranchisement of Black men seriously.

Wyoming becomes the first state to allow women to vote. 

**1892**: Journalist Carrie Langston (mother of Langston Hughes) writes in Kansas' Atchison Blade, highlighting the importance of Black women's participation in politics and criticizing men who attempted to maintain women's inferior position in society (Terborg-Penn, 58).

Thomas Moss, a friend of both Ida B. Wells Barnett and Mary Church Terrell, is lynched along with three other Black men by whites who were angry that their grocery store was competing with a white business. Both Wells Barnett and Terrell are galvanized by his murder into anti-lynching and civil rights activism, including a lifelong dedication to voting rights for African Americans. That same year, Wells Barnett is forced out of her Memphis home and to leave her paper Free Speech, amid white criticism of her printing her objection to lynching and racial discrimination (Terborg-Penn, 59). 

[Victoria Earle Matthews](/search?q=Victoria+Earle+Matthews) becomes president of the Women's Loyal Union in New York City. By 1895, Women's Loyal Union members have collected 10,000 signatures on petitions in support of the Woman Suffrage Resolution being considered by the U.S. Congress. 

**1894**: [Fannie Barrier Williams](/search?q=Fannie+Barrier+Williams) is denied membership by the Chicago Women's Club because of her race. The decision was reversed 14 months later. 

**1895**: [Adella Hunt Logan](/search?q=Adella+Hunt+Logan) becomes a member of NAWSA. Logan was also active in developing support of suffrage among members of the Tuskegee Women's Club, which became an affiliate of NACW in 1896, and of which she was an active member. 

Susan B. Anthony asks Frederick Douglass not to attend the upcoming NAWSA convention in Atlanta, so as not to upset the group's southern hosts, in an example of how white suffragists chose political expediency over loyalty to their Black allies.

The first national conference of colored women meets in Boston. At this meeting, the group decides to form a national organization, the National Federation of Afro-American Women, representing 36 Black women's clubs in 12 states, with The Woman's Era, a newspaper edited by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, as its official press outlet. 

Mary Church Terrell is appointed the first black woman on the Washington, D.C  Board of Education. 

**1896**: The National League of Colored Women, the National Federation of Afro-American Women, and more than 100 local Black women's clubs merge to form the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACW), with Mary Church Terrell as the group's first president. Other NACW leadership includes Ida B. Wells Barnett, Frances E.W. Harper, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, [Anna Julia Cooper](/search?q=Anna+Julia+Cooper), [Fanny Jackson Coppin](/search?q=Fanny+Jackson+Coppin) and others. The NACW motto is "lifting as we climb." 

In Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court rules that facilities for black can be "separate but equal." 

**1897**: With leadership from Mary Church Terrell, the Washington, D.C. Board of Education institutes the first known commemoration of Black history in American schools. Terrell successfully proposes a Frederick Douglass Day in the "colored" schools of the district to commemorate his support of abolition and women's suffrage before the Civil War.

**1898**: Mary Church Terrell speaks at the NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. 

**1900**: The annual meeting of the General Federation of Women's Clubs is held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Suffragist Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin wanted to attend the meeting as the delegate from her Woman's Era Club, but the organizers refused as the club was a Black organization, and one white woman reportedly even ripped Ruffin's membership badge from her dress. Rather than attend as a delegate from one of the mostly white groups of which she was also a member, Ruffin refused to attend altogether. What became known as the "Ruffin incident" was widely covered in newspapers nationwide, with most coverage sympathetic to Ruffin. 

At the NAWSA convention, Mary Church Terrell speaks: "When one observes how all the most honorable and lucrative positions in Church and State have been reserved for men, according to laws which they themselves have made so as to debar women; how, until recently, a married woman's property was under the exclusive control of her husband...These unjust discriminations will ever remain until the source from which they spring--the political disenfranchisement of woman&#8212;shall be removed. The injustice...extends to the nation as well, in that it is deprived of the excellent service which woman might render." She went on, "The elective franchise is withheld from one half of its citizens&#8230;because the word 'people,' by an unparalleled exhibition of lexicographical acrobatics, has been turned and twisted to mean all who were shrewd and wise enough to have themselves born boys instead of girls, or who took the trouble to be born white instead of black." This latter part of Terrell's remarks were not included in the record of the convention. 

At a celebration of Susan B. Anthony's 80th birthday, Coralie Franklin Cook is the only African-American woman asked to speak. In her remarks, she notes, "...no woman and no class of woman can be degraded and all womenkind not suffer thereby."

**1903**: During the annual NAWSA meeting in New Orleans, the organization is criticized by the Times Democrat for using an anti-Black states' rights strategy, in which it turns its back on Black women in order to attract southern support. 

Sylvanie Williams of the Phyllis Wheatley Club of New Orleans calls attention to racial segregation at the NAWSA convention in a letter to Woman's Journal. Williams, who was set to represent NACW, was denied entry. It is believed that one or more NACW members who could pass as white did attend the convention (Terborg-Penn, 92). 

**1904**: Amid criticism that Black men had been selling their votes, Mary Church Terrell responds at the NAWSA convention, "My sisters of the dominant race, stand up not only for the oppressed sex, but also for the oppressed race! (Terborg-Penn, 66)" 

**1905**:  Adella Hunt Logan writes in Colored American magazine: "If white American women, with all their natural and acquired advantages, need the ballot, that right protective of all other rights; if Anglo Saxons have been helped by it... how much more do black Americans, male and female need the strong defense of a vote to help secure them their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?"

**1907**: Mary Church Terrell publishes the article "A Colored Woman in a White World" in The Independent. 

**1908**: [Lugenia Burns Hope](/search?q=Lugenia+Burns+Hope) founds the Atlanta Neighborhood Union. The Union was a pioneer at organizing: The women divided the city into zones, districts and neighborhoods, with each assigned to a Union member. In this way, they were able to reach nearly every Black Atlantan. 

Mary Church Terrell challenges the idea of "educated suffrage" that was used to bar not only Blacks but immigrants from voting (Terborg-Penn, 68). 

Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority is founded at Howard University. 

The Equal Suffrage League, led by Sarah Garnet, collects petition signatures in favor of women's suffrage legislation. The petition read, in part, "\[W\]e, the members of The Equal Suffrage League, representing the National Association of Colored Women through its Suffrage Department…ask to have enacted such legislation as will enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution of our country, the United States of America, throughout all its sections." (Terborg-Penn,  88, 95)

**1909**: Women at the Baptist Women's Convention call attention to how suffrage could help improve the lives of Black women.

**1910**: In a speech at Howard University, Mary Church Terrell discussed her view that woman's suffrage was needed to help fight societal ills, such as intemperance, that affected Black communities as well as white communities (Terborg-Penn, 86). 

**1911**: At the NAWSA convention in Kentucky, white suffragist Anna Shaw aborts a resolution submitted by a Black suffragist "condemning disenfranchisement on the grounds of both sex and race." Her reasoning was twofold: She did not want to offend white southerners, and she said, "I am in favor of colored people voting, but white women have no enemy in the world who does more to defeat our amendments...than colored men, and until women are...permitted to vote, I am opposed to introducing...a resolution on behalf of men, who if our resolutions were carried, would go straight to the polls and defeat us every time (Terborg-Penn, 117)." 

**1912**: Women's suffrage is endorsed by Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive or "Bull Moose" Party, the first national party to support the cause. However, Roosevelt excludes Black southern delegates from the convention to appease white southerners. African Americans and some whites, including Jane Addams, protest. Mary Church Terrell declines to support Roosevelt or the Progressive Party in this context.  However, the Baptist Women's Convention Committee on the State of the Country, chaired by Mrs. L.D. Pruitt, do endorse Theodore Roosevelt for president. 

[Mary E. Jackson](/search?q=Mary+E+Jackson), president of the Rhode Island Association of Colored Women's Clubs, connects suffrage to the improvement of working conditions for Black women: "The laboring man had discovered beyond pre-adventure that his most effective weapon of defense is the ballot in his own hand. The self-supporting woman asks for and will accept nothing less." (Terborg-Penn, 74)

Mary Church Terrell contributes to an issue of the NAACP publication The Crisis devoted to arguments in favor of women's suffrage.

**1913**: NAWSA organizes the first women's suffrage march in Washington, D.C. Black women are initially barred from this first public demonstration for women's suffrage, but are eventually included, provided they march as one group at the back of the parade. Black women protested this decision, forcing NAWSA to allow them to march anywhere. Black women marched along with white women in groups organized by profession, by education and as homemakers. They also marched in state delegations, which all assembled at the back of the parade, according to the processional chart. Ida B. Wells was among the Black women who protested segregation at the parade and marched in the Illinois delegation, saying of the event, "The southern women have tried to evade the question time and again by giving some excuse or other every time it has been brought up. If the Illinois women do not take a stand now in this great democratic parade then the colored women are lost (Terborg-Penn, 122)." 

Ida Wells Barnett founds the Alpha Suffrage Club. 

A second black sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, is founded at Howard University in order to take more overtly political actions. Mary Church Terrell served as a mentor for the Deltas and wrote their vow. 

Black women found the Women's Cooperative Civic League to address problems of housing, health, sanitation and education in Baltimore due to rapid growth. Leaders divide the city into wards, with heads that report on problems to the city government, helping to ensure the needs of Black communities are being met. 

**1914**: NACW holds its ninth biennial meeting. At this point, the NACW represents 50,000 Black women in 28 state federations and more than 1,000 local groups.

**1914&#8211;15**: Ida B. Wells Barnett and members of the Alpha Suffrage Club work to register votes to try to elect black aldermen in Chicago. In 1914, Oscar DePriest solicits their help in running for an open alderman seat (Terborg-Penn, 139).

NAACP leader [Mary Talbert](/search?q=Mary+Talbert) writes an article for the August 1915 issue of the NAACP publication, The Crisis entitled "Women and Colored Women" saying, "...this struggle becomes two-fold, first, because we are women and second, because we are colored women&#8230;" In an essay in that same issue, [Nannie Helen Burroughs](/search?q=Nannie+Burroughs) responded to a white woman asking what Black women would do with the ballot: "What can she do without it?" 

[Josephine Bruce](/search?q=Josephine+Bruce), wife of Mississippi's first Black senator Blanche K. Bruce, writes editorials for NACW in which she advocates for women's suffrage.

In New Jersey, a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution fails. Newspapers report that the large number of African-American women supporting the amendment helped turn voters against it. (Terborg-Penn, 121)

The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia responds to anti-suffrage advocates' concerns by noting that Black women can be prevented from voting by the same measures used to disenfranchise Black men. (Terborg-Penn, 125)

Thanks in part to the support of the Alpha Suffrage Club, Oscar DePriest wins a Chicago alderman seat. DePriest comes out in favor of women's suffrage. Black turnout is also credited with helping William Hale Thompson to be elected mayor of Chicago.

**1917**: With World War I raging in Europe, members of the National Women's Party picket in front of the White House, holding signs with sayings like "MR. PRESIDENT: IT IS UNJUST TO DENY WOMEN A VOICE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSCRIPTING THEIR SONS" and "MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?" Women are arrested and imprisoned, and in one famous case, suffragist Alice Paul goes on a hunger strike and is brutally force-fed. Mary Church Terrell, sometimes accompanied by her teenaged daughter Phyllis, regularly picketed with the National Woman's Party. The National Woman's Party makes the decision to continue picketing even after the U.S joins the war, based on the experiences of abolitionist universal suffrage advocates, who suspended their suffrage campaign to focus on abolition during the Civil War, only to find themselves left out of suffrage for Black men after the war.

At a March meeting of the Woman Wage Earners Association, a Washington, D.C. organization, founder Jeanette Carter says, "It is no longer considered wise or expedient for women to wait for men to do for them what women should do for women." Carter pushed for women's suffrage as a way to improve the economic condition of Black women. 

After the passage of women's suffrage in Texas, Black women organize voter leagues, included the Colored Welfare League of Austin and the Negro Women Voter's League of Galveston. The groups launch voter registration drives and hold meetings to encourage voter registration (Terborg-Penn, 146). 

Black women in New York City found a chapter of the Woman Suffrage party and send a delegation to the state convention. In September, [Annie K. Lewis](/search?q=Annie+K+Lewis) is elected vice president of the New York Woman Suffrage Party, in a notable instance of a Black woman being elected to a leadership office in an interracial organization. 

In November 1917, the New York state legislature approved a suffrage bill that enfranchised more than 75,000 African-American women. Black women help elect New York's first Black representative to the state assembly and the first Black representative on the Board of Aldermen (Terborg-Penn, 134, 142). 

**1918**: After resisting the lobbying of Carrie Chapman Catt in NAWSA and the picketing and hunger strikes organized by Alice Paul, President Woodrow Wilson finally capitulates and says woman's suffrage is needed as a "war measure." He stalled as long as he possibly could, saying at best that it was an issue that should be decided in the states, a position that was counter to the goal of suffragists who wanted a constitutional amendment.

Mississippi Senator John Sharpe Williams proposes an amendment to the Anthony suffrage amendment that would permit only white women to vote. 

James Calloway writes an article for the Macon Telegraph in which he attempts to discredit Susan B. Anthony by pointing out her friendships with Black women. His article is reprinted and circulated by suffrage opponents. Anthony invited black women to stay at her Rochester, NY, home, challenging white resistance to social equality. Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells were just two of several women who stayed as guests at her home. However, Anthony was also willing to sacrifice black women's voting rights if it could help her achieve her goal of white women's enfranchisement.

Black women in New York City found four chapters of Negro Women Voters across Queens County and, in Harlem, Black women found the Women's Non-Partisan League. 

Gertrude E. Curtis and Laura B. Fisher are chosen as delegates to the New York State Republican convention. 

**1919**: Mississippi Senator Pat Harrison unsuccessfully attempts to change the wording of the original Anthony amendment to include only white women. 

Mary Church Terrell is asked by NAWSA leader Ida Harper to convince the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs to withdraw their request for NAWSA membership. In her request, Harper explained that NAWSA head Carrie Chapman Catt was concerned that accepting the membership would alienate Southern white voters, and that fear of Black women voting was the primary obstacle to ratification (Terborg-Penn, 130). Terrell refuses, instead warning her friend Elizabeth Carter, head of the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs of NAWSA's intentions. 

The 19th Amendment is passed by both houses of Congress and the ratification process begins. The amendment gives the vote to nearly 3 million Black women; three quarters of them live in the American South (Terborg-Penn, 151). 

**August 26, 1920**: The 19th Amendment becomes law, giving women the right to vote. NAWSA disbands and many white women join the new nonpartisan League of Women Voters. However, many Black women in the South continued to face significant obstacles, already put in place by racist white officials to limit black men's voting rights, to actually casting their ballots.
