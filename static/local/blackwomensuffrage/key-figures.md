## Charlotte Vandine Forten
### 1785-1884
Charlotte Vandine Forten was the matriarch of a financially well-off and prominent Black family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Forten's husband James was a sailmaker. Her daughters Margaretta Forten, Sarah Louise Forten Purvis and Harriet D. Forten Purvis, often referred to as the "Forten Sisters," were, along with their parents, active in the abolitionist movement. James Forten was a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, but as the group did not permit women to join, Charlotte and her daughters joined with a like-minded group of women to form the Phiadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. This was the first biracial organization of female abolitionists in the United States, and one of six abolitionist groups the Forten family helped to found and finance.

## Harriet Forten Purvis
### 1810-1875
One of the well-known "Forten Sisters," Harriet Forten Purvis was the daughter of Charlotte Vandine Forten and James Forten, prominent Black abolitionists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Like her sisters, she was an active abolitionist and suffragist. She helped establish the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society along with her mother and sisters; it was the first biracial women's abolitionist group in the United States. Forten served as a co-chair of the society's fairs, which raised money for the group's anti-slavery work. She also served on the society's sewing committee, which established a sewing school in a poor area of Philadelphia. She was active in the group's boycott of goods, including cotton and fruits and vegetables, that were produced with slave labor. In 1832, Forten married Robert Purvis, with whom she had five children. Purvis, who was of mixed race, was the scion of another prominent abolitionist family from Philadelphia, and the two were at the center of Philadelphia's abolitionist community. They welcomed fugitive slaves into their Byberry, Pennsylvania, home, which became a major station on the Underground Railroad. Abolition, however, was not Forten Purvis's only cause--she was also a firm believer in equality for all and women's rights. Along with her sister Margaretta, she helped organize the fifth National Woman's Rights Convention in Philadelphia in 1854 and was active with the American Equal Rights Association (AERA),  a biracial group that advocated for universal suffrage. Forten Purvis also lectured on civil rights topics, speaking out against segregation in the years after the Civil War.

## Margaretta Forten
### c.1815-1875 
A member of the prominent Forten family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Margaretta joined her sisters and mother in becoming a charter member of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1833 and was selected along with 13 others to draft the group's constitution. Like her sister Harriet Forten Purivs, Forten remained active in the group for its nearly four decades of existence, serving at different points as its recording secretary and treasurer and representing the group at statewide abolitionist meetings. She worked on the society's membership, education, petition campaign and annual antislavery fair committees, and was particularly active in the donation of books to Black schools. She also raised money for charitable causes related to abolition. Forten was an ardent suffragist, and was a member of the biracial American Equal Rights Association (AERA). She helped collect petitions for the Women's National League and helped organize the 1854 National Women's Rights Convention in Philadelphia. In addition to her work as an abolitionist and suffragist, Forten worked as an educator for nearly four decades, teaching and then founding her own grammar school in 1850. Forten never married, and cared for her parents in their later years.

## Harriet Purvis, Jr. 
### 1839-1904
The daughter of prominent abolitionists and equal rights activists Harriet Forten Purvis and Robert Purvis, Harriet Purvis, Jr., known as Hattie, grew up in a household that was at the center of the abolitionist movement in Pennsylvania, as well as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Her parents associated with a variety of well-known social reformers including Susan B. Anthony and Lucretia Mott. She attended the highly progressive Friends Eagleswood School, a coeducational and biracial institution in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, founded by abolitionist Theodore Weld. From a young age, Purvis was active in abolitionist and women's rights work. Considered part of the second generation of American suffragists, she became a member of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, founded in part by her grandmother, mother and aunts,  in 1866. From 1866 to 1869, she worked with her mother on the group's annual anti-slavery fair to raise funds for the group's abolitionist activities. A committed suffragist, she attended the 1866 National Woman's Rights Convention and became a member of the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), a group she served as corresponding and recording secretary until the group ceased operations in 1869. She joined the Pennsylvania Woman's Suffrage Association, serving on its executive committee, and was a delegate to the National American Woman's Suffrage Association from 1883 to 1900, as well as the group's  first African-American vice president. She worked closely for much of her life with Susan B. Anthony to advocate for women's rights. Purvis was also active in the temperance movement, joining the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and encouraging Black women to embrace the movement.

## Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute;
### 1880-1958
Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute; was born into a prominent biracial abolitionist family from Boston. Her great-aunts were the well-known white abolitionist and suffragist sisters Sarah and Angelina Grimk&eacute;.  Grimk&eacute;'s parents split when she was just 3 years old, and although she initially lived with her white mother, at 7 she was returned to her biracial father's care and never saw her mother again. Raised by her well-off father Archibald Grimk&eacute;, who was a lawyer and the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Grimk&eacute; was educated at some of the best schools in Massachusetts. She became an English teacher in her early 20s, working at the Armstrong Manual Training School and what would become Dunbar High School, both in Washington, D.C., and continuing her education in the summers. At Dunbar, Grimk&eacute; made the acquaintance of a group of Black women writers, and began writing about her observations of black life and racism, among other topics. Her writing, which included poetry, plays, essays and short stories, is often described as having helped lay the groundwork for the Harlem Renaissance. Among Grimk&eacute;'s most well-known works is the play Rachel, published in 1920 in response to NAACP founder W.E.B. Dubois's call for the creation of theater by and for Black people. The play tells the story of a young Black woman who decides she will not bring children into a world plagued by racism. According to historian Elizabeth Brown-Guillory, it was the first play written by a Black woman to become a "fully staged professional production." In addition, Grimk&eacute;'s poetry has been included in several prominent anthologies of Black poetry. Some of Grimk&eacute; writings published after her death in 1958 confirm that she was also a lesbian, the suppression of which, combined with her abandonment by her mother, may have contributed to the themes of pain and despair apparent in her writing.

## Charlotte Forten Grimk&eacute;
### 1837-1914
Charlotte Forten Grimk&eacute; was born into the prominent Black abolitionist Forten family in Philadelphia. Her paternal grandparents were the abolitionists and equal rights advocates Charlotte Vandine Forten and James Forten. Forten's mother died when she was just 3 years old, and her father, Robert Bridges Forten, did not want her to attend Philadelphia's segregated schools. Instead, at 16 years old, she was sent to the more progressive Salem, Massachusetts, where she boarded with the Remond family, who were also prominent Black abolitionists. She began keeping a diary while studying at Higginson Grammar School for Girls, where she was the only Black student. These diaries became a lifelong habit and they were posthumously published in 1988, offering insight into Black life in the final years of slavery and the time immediately after abolition. During her time in Salem, Forten became a member of the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society and was active in sewing items to sell at the group's annual anti-slavery fundraising fairs, as well as a frequent attendee of anti-slavery lectures. In 1856, Forten became the first-ever Black graduate of what would become Salem State University. Wishing to support herself without the help of a husband, she became a teacher at an all white-school in Salem and began writing poetry, some of which was published in William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator. Following in her family's activist footsteps, Forten moved to the Sea Islands of South Carolina in 1862 as part of an effort to educate enslaved people on plantations abandoned by their owners when Union forces gained control of the area at the beginning of the Civil War. Although she left the islands after the death of her father and repeated bouts of pneumonia in 1864, she wrote about her time there in the two-part essay "Life in the Sea Islands," which was published in Atlantic Monthly. The essay depicted a Black population eager to learn, support themselves and assume the new responsibilities of citizenship. Back in Massachusetts, she served as secretary of the Freedmen's Union Commission's Boston branch. Forten later returned to teaching in South Carolina and at an all-black school in Washington, D.C. and clerked at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. When she was 41, Forten married the Reverend Francis Grimk&eacute;, who was 13 years her junior. Grimk&eacute; was the son of a white plantation owner named Henry Grimk&eacute; and his black enslaved worker Nancy Weston. He and his brother Archibald, who would become the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), became free at the end of the Civil War. Grimk&eacute;'s education at Lincoln University was subsidized by his aunts, the white abolitionist and suffragist sisters Sarah and Angelina Grimk&eacute;. After her marriage, Forten Grimk&eacute; continued her activism, joining the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) and advocating for women's suffrage. She also continued to write poetry and essays calling for an end to racial injustice and violence.

## Sarah Remond
### 1826-1827
Sarah Remond was the daughter of a prominent free Black abolitionist family in Salem, Massachusetts. In addition to advocating for abolition, the Remond family was a vocal critic of school segregation and pushed for integrated schools in Salem, which became the first town in Massachusetts to enact integrated public schools in 1844. An avid reader, Remond become Involved in the abolitionist cause at a young age and frequently attended anti-slavery lectures in Salem and Boston. In 1853, she purchased a ticket to attend an opera at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston, but was then forcibly removed from the theater on account of her race. In response, she successfully sued the theater and won a small cash settlement. In 1856, at age 30, Remond joined her brother Charles on his lecture tour of New York, even giving short speeches at several stops. Over the course of the next two years, she gave lectures at anti-slavery meetings in several states. In 1858, she left the U.S. for England, on a mission to win English support for the abolitionist cause. Her lectures describing the atrocities of slavery and racial injustice were well-received. In addition to giving 45 lectures in 25 cities and towns across England, Ireland and Scotland, Remond also pursued continued education at the Bedford College for Ladies. After the Civil War, she continued to live in London, where she became a member of the London Emancipation Society and the Freedmen's Aid Association, working to raise money and supplies for the newly emancipated. Remond left London for Florence in 1866, where she attended medical school and then practiced medicine for two decades.

## Charlotte "Lottie" Rollin
### 1849-?
Charlotte Rollin, known as Lottie, was the second eldest of the well-known Rollin Sisters of South Carolina. Rollin's mixed-race parents were financially prosperous and Lottie and her sisters Frances Ann, Kate, Louisa and Florence Rollin all attended secondary school in the North and became early women's suffrage activists. After the Civil War, Lottie and her sister Kate established a school for freedmen in Charleston. The family moved to Columbia, and Lottie went on to work as a clerk at the South Carolina State House. The sisters were influential in the politics of the Reconstructon-era South and held well-attended salons at the Columbia, South Carolina residence that the four younger sisters shared. In 1869, Rollin gave a speech on the floor of the South Carolina House of Representatives in favor of universal suffrage. The next year, she was the chair and founder of the South Carolina Woman's Rights Association, and in 1871,  she led a meeting at the state capitol pushing for women's suffrage. A member of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) and the organizer of its South Carolina chapter, Rollin wrote in an 1871 article in the AWSA's Woman's Journal: "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings and as such entitled to all human rights."  In 1872, Rollin worked alongside her sisters, as well as AWSA leader Lucy Stone, to push for an ultimately ill-fated constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage in South Carolina.  As Reconstruction came to an end, and Blacks began to lose their hard-won political power, Rollin feared persecution from the Ku Klux Klan and left South Carolina for Brooklyn.

## Mary Ann Shadd Cary
### 1823-1893

Mary Ann Shadd was born the eldest of 13 children to free Black parents in the slaveholding state of Delaware. Her parents were abolitionists and her childhood home was a stop on the Underground Railroad, which helped enslaved people escape to freedom in Canada. The Shadd family moved to Pennsylvania to escape Delaware's prohibition on the education of Black children, and Shadd attended a Quaker-run school there. She became a teacher, working in Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware, but after the 1850 passage of the Fugitive Slave Act, she moved to Canada, where Shadd believed she could more effectively advocate for abolition. She began writing articles urging American Blacks to move North and giving advice on settling in Canada, and in 1853, she became the editor of The Provincial Freeman, a newspaper written expressly for Blacks and escaped slaves. Published under the motto "Self-Reliance is the Fine Road to Independence," it was the first newspaper in North America to be edited by an African American woman and Canada's first anti-slavery newspaper. In her writings, Shadd was critical of the male-dominated abolitionist groups that she believed spoke too much and did too little. Shadd frequently took risky trips back to the United States to gather news for her paper, speak to Blacks about life in Canada and sell the subscriptions that paid for the printing of the paper. In 1856, she married a Canadian named Thomas Cary. The couple had two children together before his death several years later. In 1859, facing financial difficulties, The Provincial Freeman ceased publication and Shadd Cary worked as a teacher in an integrated school in Chatham, Ontario. She returned to the United States after the outbreak of the Civil War, working to recruit Black soldiers to the Union war effort. After the war, she moved to Washington, D.C. where she opened a school for the children of newly freed Blacks. In 1870, she became the first Black woman in U.S. history to earn a law degree and became active in the women's suffrage movement. Addressing the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in 1874, she urged them to rectify the fact that although she paid equal taxes, she did not have equal rights. In 1880, Shadd Cary founded the Colored Women's Progressive Franchise Association, which urged Black women to fight for suffrage and equal rights.
