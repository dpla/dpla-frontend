**1868**: Senator Samuel Pomeroy (R-KS) introduces a federal universal suffrage amendment, but the Senate quickly refuses to vote on it. 

Four Black women are among the 172 women who cast mock ballots in Vineland, New Jersey, after being blocked from participating in an election. This was part of a strategy to challenge the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to include women. This strategy, endorsed at the 1871 NWSA convention, was supported by black suffragists Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Sojourner Truth and Mrs. Beatty of Portland, Oregon. (Terborg-Penn, p. 38)

William J. Whipper, husband of Charlotte Rollin, argues for suffrage for women and Black men as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention. 

**1869**: AERA dissolves after infighting over support for the 15th Amendment, which would give African-American men the right to vote, but ignore women's suffrage. In the wake of AERA's demise, the movement split: One group of white suffragists, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, found the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). During this period, Stanton in particular expresses racist views, criticizing the ability of Black men to be responsible voters. The resulting NWSA strategy also "pitted Black men against women in a racist way." (Terborg-Penn, p 27). Meanwhile, Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell and Julia Ward Howe form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The two groups move forward with different strategies: NWSA pursues a federal amendment, while AWSA takes a state-by-state approach. Black women join and are active in both groups, although more Black women choose the AWSA. Frances E.W. Harper, Charlotte Forten, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin  and Sojourner Truth are among those that join the AWSA, while Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Harriet Purvis and Hattie Purvis are among those that join the NWSA. 

Wyoming becomes the first American territory to grant women suffrage. 

At the 1869 AERA meeting in New York City, Frances E.W. Harper weighs in on the Black suffrage vs. women's suffrage debate; she supports suffrage for Black men, saying "When it was a question of race, [I] let the lesser question of sex go. But the white women all go for sex, letting race occupy a minor position." (Terborg-Penn, p 32). As white women at the meeting spoke out against suffrage for Black men, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton's remarks against the idea of "ignorant Negroes and foreigners to make laws for her to obey," Harper responded: If the nation could handle only one question, [I] would not have Black women put a single straw in the way, if only the men of the race could obtain what they wanted." White feminists Lucy Stone and Abby Kelly Foster joined her in this position. (Terborg-Penn p. 32)

At the 1870, South Carolina Woman's Rights Association convention, Charlotte Rollin says, "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings, and as such entitled to all human rights." According to historian Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, Rollin's speech is the first by an African-American woman other than Sojourner Truth to be preserved by white suffrage leaders in their history of the suffrage movement. (Terborg-Penn, p. 45)

**1871**: Mary Ann Shadd Cary unsuccessfully attempts to register to vote in Washington, D.C., challenging the language of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Using her legal training, Cary unsuccessfully argues that as a taxpayer in the District of Columbia, she should have the same rights as male taxpayers. 

Charlotte Rollin writes in an 1871 article in the AWSA's Woman's Journal: "We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings and as such entitled to all human rights."

**1872**: Sojourner Truth shows up to vote at a polling station in Battle Creek, Michigan, but is turned away. 

White suffragist Virginia Minor and her husband Francis sue the St. Louis registrar for barring Virginia Minor from voting, arguing the Fourteenth Amendment has been misinterpreted. The United States Supreme Court eventually decides against the Minors. As a result of this case, suffragists realize they need to push for a new constitutional amendment rather than trying to challenge the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

**1873**: Frances E.W. Harper delivers the closing speech at the AWSA convention in New York City, saying, "much as white women need the ballot, colored women need it more."

**1900**: The Ruffin Incident: Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin 

At the NAWSA convention, Mary Church Terrell speaks: "When one observes how all the most honorable and lucrative positions in Church and State have been reserved for men, according to laws which they themselves have made so as to debar women; how, until recently, a married woman's property was under the exclusive control of her husband...These unjust discriminations will ever remain until the source from which they spring--the political disenfranchisement of woman--shall be removed. The injustice...extends to the nation as well, in that it is deprived of the excellent service which woman might render." She went on, "The elective franchise is withheld from one half of its citizens…because the word ‘people,' by an unparalleled exhibition of lexicographical acrobatics, has been turned and twisted to mean all who were shrewd and wise enough to have themselves born boys instead of girls, or who took the trouble to be born white instead of black." This latter part of Terrell's remarks were not recorded in the record of the convention. 

At a celebration of Susan B. Anthony's 80th birthday, Coralie Franklin Cook is the only African-American woman asked to speak. In her remarks, she notes, "...no woman and no class of woman can be degraded and all women kind not suffer thereby."

Williams, who was set to represent NACW, was denied entry. It is believed that one or more NACW members who could pass as white did attend the convention. (Terborg-Penn, p. 92)

**1904**: Amid criticism that Black men had been selling their votes, Mary Church Terrell responds at the NAWSA convention, "My sisters of the dominant race, stand up not only for the oppressed sex, but also for the oppressed race!" (Terborg-Penn, p. 66) 

**1905**: Adella Hunt Logan writes in Colored American magazine: "If white American women, with all their natural and acquired advantages, need the ballot, that right protective of all other rights; if Anglo Saxons have been helped by it... how much more do black Americans, male and female need the strong defense of a vote to help secure them their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?"
