## Who We Are & What We Do

The Vermont Green Mountain Digital Archive (GMDA) is a collaborative effort of several partner institutions that joined together to support a Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) service hub for Vermont. This unified discovery portal makes it possible for researchers from around the world to search across our collective holdings simultaneously and to browse a diverse aggregation of content.  Although most materials relate to Vermont, partner institutions have also shared documentation of the world beyond our “Brave Little State.”
